    "### Tasting Considerations\n",
    "* Aroma: The odor of the tea liquor, also called the nose or fragrance. A complex aroma is often described as a bouquet. \n",
    "* Astringency: A lively and mouth-drying effect on the tongue. Not bitter, but a clean and refreshing quality. The sensation of astringency is caused by a reaction between polyphenols (tannins) and the protein in saliva. \n",
    "* Body: The tactile aspect of tea’s weight and substance in the mouth, variously subcategorized as light, medium, or full; also known as fullness. \n",
    "* Bright: A lively, clean style that refreshes the palate. \n",
    "* Character: A tea’s signature attributes depending upon origin, whether of its country, region or type. \n",
    "* Clean: Indicates purity of flavor and an absence of any off-tastes. \n",
    "* Finish: The lasting taste on your tongue after swallowing the tea. \n",
    "* Flowery: A floral nose or flavor associated with high grade teas. \n",
    "* Full: References a positive sensation of body and good heft; indicates a well-made tea, possessing color, strength, substance and roundness. \n",
    "* Malty: A sweet malt flavor that is characteristic of Assam black teas. \n",
    "* Muscatel: A flavor reminiscent of grapes, most often used to describe an exceptional characteristic found in the liquors of the finest Darjeelings. \n",
    "* Smooth: Round-bodied, fine-drinking teas. \n",
    "* Soft: Smooth, lush, and subsequently often (but not necessarily) timid in flavor; not a negative term. \n",
    "* Thick: Describes liquor having substance, but not necessarily strength. \n",
    "* Vegetal: A characteristic of green teas that might include grassy, herby or marine flavors."

I know Thanksgiving is an American holiday, but I hope everybody everywhere has things to be grateful for everyday. I think it’s important to take a few minutes at least once a day to be grateful for all that I have, all that I am, and all that I’m yet to be, and to wish for wonderful things in the lives of others as well.I started my day by making 3 pie crusts, all gluten free. One is for a pie that I’ve made for years called Chocolate Midnight (Originally Chocolate Almond Midnight because of a praline almond decorative topping I omitted, from the vegan Millenium Cookbook) It’s the most decadent chocolate cheesecake textured pie you’ll ever eat, and you’ll never know it’s made with silken tofu. I know you don’t believe me, if you’ve ever had a silken tofu ‘fail’ dessert, and believe me, when I was a vegan (for years and years), I tried my share.Baby, this is the real deal, and many people have fallen in love with this pie, not knowing the tofu truth, and once they found out, they didn’t care, it’s that good. It’s requested by several people every year &amp; is a required part of our family feast. This year I took the gluten out of the crust.I’m in the break, between crust making and pie filling making. I had a hearty breakfast and my last cup of Stacy’s Taiwanese Assam. I’ve reviewed it several times, and it is bold and tasty, but now it’s gone. I foresee a Butiki order coming soon.', 'Sometimes you just need an old favourite. This morning was one of those days. I had let the wonder of this tea become a mere shadow of its true deliciousness. I’m glad I dug this out earlier…just needed a reminder of how much I love it!', 'Wowwwww, this is delicious! Definitely glad I ordered some (shoulda got my free ounce of this instead of Strawberry Oolong!) It reminds me quite a bit of Laoshan Black, in that it’s very malty and chocolatey, but there’s quite a fruitiness to it as well. I had this in the Timolino, so I need to write a more detailed tasting note later, but this is definitely a winner for me. And the leaves are crazy huge, thin, wiry, unbroken. Fabulous!I’m drinking the second infusion right now. It’s heading towards astringent in spite of only a 3-minutes infusion, but it’s still good. I’m sure it would be better re-steeped immediately instead of sitting all day.Rating tentatively placed, but may increase upon proper evaluation.', 'This week has been pretty busy for us. We just got back from vacation mid week which was really a work vacation and will start prepping for another office closure as we will probably be taking off for another 2 weeks in about two weeks but this time for a real vacation. Also, we received in a ton of tea, including many new teas. We are also changing up a few teas. Here is a sneak peek of just a few of the many changes:Adding: Hattialli Golden Paw (very similar to our Hattialli Golden Lion)Changing: Irish Cream Cheesecake. Based on the reviews, we are thinking the base is just wrong for the flavoring. We used our everyday Sourenee, which is very good but also very fickle. It can be pretty challenging to get that tea to its sweet spot and it can turn astringent if the water cools too much.Changing: Sourenee. We are exchanging the current everyday Sourenee for a very high quality limited edition Sourenee.Adding: Hello Sweetie. It’s coming soon but first we will be doing a promotion with it.Changing: Da Yu Ling. We moved too slowly on the Da Yu Ling for the winter harvest but the Fu Shou Shan is a fantastic replacement!Adding: A baked Ali Shan.Mi Xian: Just a little warning. We are low on Mi Xian right now and will not be able to get more when we run out as it is scarce at the moment.These are just a few additions and changes. There are many more to come and many more flavors in the works, including the Custom Blend Contest tea which is getting close to finishing the recipe. We will also be removing a few flavors and teas that just aren’t up to the standards of the rest of the teas. I would love to hear any suggestions from anyone who believes there is a tea that should be removed from our collection.On to the tea! This harvest has a slightly deeper dark chocolate note. There really isn’t much difference from this harvest and the last harvest but the chocolate is stronger and the malt is slightly stronger. There are less stems, which is fantastic! The upgrade version on the other hand has some cherry notes that were not detectable in the previous version.', 'Yowza! I was starting to think that I wouldn’t need to order any more of this tea because the Caramel Vanilla is so amazing, but this cup convinced me that I need both.', 'Reading my book and sipping on this for the last two hours.I made it the way I really like it when I have all the time in the world for it. I fill the gaiwan with leaves, really, I fill it almost to the top. This tea is light in weight, so for me, that’s the best way to extract all the goodness I know is in there. It might seems like a lot of tea to waist, but it’s no waist when you can brew it for several hours. And the steeps remain rich and flavourful. A good night companion…This is another one from Butiki I’m hoping will never disappear!(See previous notes)', 'Still kind of disappointed I missed the Butiki sale due to vacation, but I still have enough of this to last me a little while, so I can’t complain too much. :-) I’m on my 4th steep of the morning. It went so well with the buttermilk scone I had for breakfast. See other notes for details.', 'Prepped according to the below parameters – 2 tsp. leaf to 8 oz. water as per package directions.The last few nights at work were rough but I don’t go back in until Thursday night at least. Sometimes I wonder what I was thinking, becoming a nurse. I love it but I’m such an introvert that I get positively drained after a few shifts and need the time to recover.  Speaking of introverts, I discovered I’m an INFJ recently. Anybody else know their MBTI type?I say all this to explain why I’m drinking a strong cup of this malty, chocolate wonder now, instead of going straight to bed. It is so smooth, rich and comforting. Something about the smell of a freshly brewed, good black tea just relaxes me, and this is no exception. Strange how a tea can manage to be both calming and energizing simultaneously – but this one does that.Just what I needed for right now…', 'I fixed my Steepster at work problem and now I can load it again at work! Maybe not great for my productivity but great for my overall happiness.Sipdown, 116. I have a lot of Taiwanese black teas in my sipdown list, but this is my favorite for sure. It’s not too fruity-floral but it does have nicely fruity notes. Caramel, sometimes a hint of cocoa, and hard to really oversteep. Definitely will restock this one, perhaps on Black Friday!', 'The leaves of this tea are stunning! Twisty and wirey with almost a blue tone hue to them.  The steeped cup is a lovely deep golden amber tone and smells of sweet potato and chocolate! OMG yes!  This cup is DELICIOUS! For my facebook friends who may be reading this – as I am going to be posting the review there as well…if you are not used to really high quality amazing tea like this just understand – this is not your mother’s or grandmother’s Lipton tea! Haha, my grandmother, bless her heart would drink that instant powdered tea daily, you know the stuff that came in the glass jar with the green lid. Today it is probably in plastic but regardless – this is a true delight and anyone who is even considering trying a different black tea should give this one a go!  There is a very sweet aspect to the tea, it has notes of sweet potato pie, even a bake-y element to it but it is not that sweet – not like as if someone spooned sugar into the cup – just a very natural sweetness. There are strong notes of chocolate and also notes of honey.  A very rich cup yet the mouthfeel is bright and cheery. It is not too heavy or syrupy. This may be one of my new favorites! I wish I had tried this one sooner!  As if I do not have enough teas to drink I have added this one to my shopping list!  There is a slight very light note of cinnamon or some kick of spiciness here but nothing that my weenie husband could not handle …(love you babe)… and oddly enough I am even getting a bit of a saffron note!  As the tea cools a bit it does become slightly thicker with a heavier mouthfeel and notes of maple syrup begin to peek through.  I know it sounds like I am talking about a dessert not a tea yet this is not a dessert tea but rather a wonderful black tea that anyone would love!'], 'Polarity': [0.24780701754385964, 0.215, 0.22731829573934836, 0.12239389776889774, 0.3666666666666667, 0.32083333333333336, 0.012499999999999999, 0.14273268398268396, 0.13819444444444445, 0.2731600935828877], 'Mouthfeel': '  A very rich cup yet the mouthfeel is bright and cheery.

A bit of creamy vanilla, too. I can detect the cherry, but only if I really focus – maybe I’m willing the flavor into existence. Handed the cup to the husband for him to sip, only telling him, “It’s Cocoa Amore.” He gets the cherry flavor immediately.

Not because it’s a bad tea but when you’ve got a stupidly long list of amazing teas from Stacy, at some point, SOME of them need to fall off the list. IE. it’s a fantastic tea! but there are 10 more amazing, incredible teas that i love EVEN MORE from stacy, that this one is just not amazing enough haha. or at least only enough to get every few months. I enjoyed the sweetness of this cup compared to the other 2 teas i drank at work today. It was a good contrast to them and made me enjoy this even more today. Sadly, it’s almost gone…but that means room for more stacy teas! woot woot!', 'Ok…. I swear I’m reviewing this tea, brewing up a mate and making a matcha latte and going to work for at least a few hours, if not an all-nighter. Being a grad student sucks, especially when you promised your advisor you’d have all your samples ground by the end of September, only to realize that you still have 116 hours of grinding (at least!) left…. :(Anyways! Enough whining. This sample was given to me by the lovely <strong>Sil</strong> during our awesome tea &amp; pizza meetup a few weeks ago!I honestly am not sure what to be expecting here, as I can’t recall reading anything about this tea. The aroma is a bit chocolatey, a bit “generic black”-y. Wow, is this ever smooth! Definite chocolate notes and… woah, there’s a sort of sweetness in here that I completely wasn’t expecting! A dark sort of sweetness, like with dark oolongs… intriguing. So chocolatey, kind of almost a… buckwheat honey sort of sweetness, and no astringency. This is my sort of black! I do wish there was a bit more chocolate (only because I love that flavour in black teas), but the sweetness more than makes up for it! Delicious! I’d definitely buy this one to drink again, this is pretty good! Thanks Sil!', 'Sad sip-down! I really like this one.I drank this at work, so I didn’t steep it at boiling and I got a whole new flavor profile. This time it seemed even smoother and I swear there were mushroom notes and this time I actually am picking up some lychee. I didn’t taste that when I steeped it at boiling.', 'I have a guilty little confession about this tea. I love it! I love it so much that I really acquired it more for myself rather than because it filled a hole in our tea selection. This is my reward tea. Whenever I am feeling down or when I accomplish something big, I allow myself to indulge in a few cups of this wonderful tea.The dried leaf aroma is strong with honey and plums and the leaves are thin, long, and wiry with a rich charcoal and mahogany color. The steeped leaves are more mahogany in color and range from a medium to dark brown. The wet leaves smell woody and sweet with a honey scent and now a peach aroma as well. As I open the leaves, I can see some little ridges from where the leafhoppers were allowed to nibble. This nibbling causes the plant to initiate its healing process making the leaves taste sweet like honey. The liquor is a dark amber color and produces an aroma of honey and wet wood. When I take my first sip, peach and honey notes first hit my tongue and mingle and linger. Then citrus notes and lychee notes become prominent and linger. A smooth and creamy mouth feel make this cup very enjoyable for me. I used 2 teaspoons of tea this time; however, I think I enjoy this a little more with just 1 ½ teaspoons of tea for 8oz of water. Either way, this is a delicious cup of tea.', 'I see that the last time I drank this I didn’t really write a tasting note because I was distracted. Well, I guess I better remedy that!This is quite a lovely tea. It is kind of one of those black teas that reminds me of a honeyed dan cong oolong, but better because it’s a black tea (not the biggest fan of dan congs here). Anyway, this is definitely on the fruitier side for a black tea, and I do get a sense of stone fruit (peach, apricot) and a hint of lychee. There is almost a floral quality as well. I’m usually not the biggest fan of fruity (unflavored) black teas for some reason, but this one I quite enjoy. I think I like it best when it is toward the hot side versus once it really cools down… as it gets just warm it starts reminding me of a darjeeling (fruity florals, I guess). Quite tasty overall.', 'Heading out the door to let the chiropractor work his magic.  I’ve enjoyed this tasty tea! Sil’s post about it reminded me that I was still hoarding the final cup. First Sipdown of the day!', '<strong>Note to self</strong>: Drinking a whole pot of tea before walking into an exam <em>may</em> not be the best idea in the future. Probably should have double checked that scantron.Today this tea was as amazing as I remember it being- juicy, smooth, and totally worth it.', '1 heaping tbsp in 16 ozYummy as always. Today, I felt a little extra sensitive to astringency, though. There is a slight hint of astringency in this tea… barely any at all, really, but today I was feeling it a little more pronounced than usual. So, I did the unthinkable and added a 1/2 tsp of sugar to the 16 oz of tea. That just smoothed it out for me without changing the flavor.I’ve decided not to beat myself up over adding just a tiny bit of sugar to my tea if I feel like it. I know that a gorgeous tea like this one doesn’t <em>need</em> it, but sometimes I just want my tea a little extra sweet and juicy. Not always, just now and then.I am cold-steeping the used leaves overnight for what I know will be a delicious iced tea I can drink with my lunch tomorrow. Yay!', 'Wow. All I can say is wow. After drinking the aged tea I wanted something sweet to end my taiwainese tasting day and debated between wild mountain black and this one. I ended up with this one only because I haven’t had it in a while. I brewed it gongfu for the first time ever. The first steep seriously took my breath away. Smells and tastes like butter, honey, and peaches. So sweet and juicy. Oh my. Taiwan… you have truly won me over today. I was a pretty die hard china fan, but I can open up my heart for you.Side note… I’ve been using this tiny little strainer that <strong>Meiqin</strong> from Yezi sent me as a free gift to pour my gongfu teas through and I am in love with it.

I also poured on my new favorite – great value chipotle ranch dressing. It is not overly spicy. Just the right mix of spicy and creamy, but it is more potent than some teas could handle.

I’ve benefitted greatly from their free samples, and am happy to review their teas. This time the sample offering was of their new spring harvest green teas, but she also asked if there were any other teas I’d like to try. I have been wanting to try this one since they released it, so of course I asked for it! Thanks so much for sending it along Angel!The dry leaf is gorgeous, all curly with lots of golden tips. I am actually now on my second cup of this tea. The first time I used half of one of my little sample pouches for my 12oz mug and brewed it at the steeping parameters I’ve used for similar Fujian blacks (and what they recommend for this tea), namely 185°F for 2 minutes. The resulting cup smelled and tasted nice but was also pretty weak. I was craving more so I used the second half of the pouch to steep it at 195°F for 3 minutes.This smells lovely, like molasses and grains, which is what I look for in a tan yang. The sweet, caramelly, malty, grainy flavors are all there, but still not quite right in the second cup. The second cup is more robust but the flavors are still somehow muted. I think I need to use more leaf… good thing Angel was generous enough to send two more sample pouches of this tea. Also I now have a full pouch’s worth of once-steeped leaves to resteep and play around with. I won’t rate this one until I’ve played around with it more, but even as it is now it would be in the 80s (which remember on my new rating system is very good). I just have a feeling from what I’m getting now that this is actually spectacular, it’s just my brewing of it that is off.', 'I’ve had 3 cups of this today and am loving it! I’m going to have it again tomorrow in the morning and do a lengthier review.', 'Oh dear, I can feel that this is going to be a really long post. I’ll let you all know when I’m going to actually start writing about the tea, so you can skip ahead if you like.My Teavivre order arrived! I wasn’t even expecting it yet. I’ve ordered stuff from China before, obviously, and I <em>know</em> it usually takes a couple of weeks to get here, but I don’t know why I hadn’t realised that it had actually been that long since I ordered.Oh well, I’m certainly not complaining! :D I have unpacked my tea and the cats have given the box and the wrappings a <em>very</em> thorough sniffing. I don’t know what they kept the wrapping supplies next to in China, but whatever it is, it’s very interesting to cats.While the wrapping was undergoing such a detailed inspection, I tried to decide which one to try first. And then I smacked my forehead because DUH! Self, don’t be an eedjit. You obviously start with the Tan Yang.If you are wondering what’s so obvious about that, you have not been following me for long enough. Fujian produces the majority of all my very favourite black teas, and my most beloved type of all is Tan Yang. This is the type where I have been known to draw little hearts on the label. So yeah. Obvious. :)The first time I ordered from Teavivre, I believe the company was still very young, but they had marched right into the hearts of many Steepsterites with their high quality and their sample program. For me, it was the Bailin gong fu that finally drew me in and made me place that first order. There was a contact form on the site that you could fill out if you had questions or suggestions, so I asked if they were planning on stocking a Tan Yang in the future. I can’t remember what exactly the reply was, but I think I was told that they would look into it.Some time passed and eventually Teavivre did indeed offer a Tan Yang. Oh, how I coveted it! But unfortunately circumstances conspired against me and I didn’t feel like the time was right to buy it. We’ve been frugal, you know, what with having our wedding and then a bit later Husband having a stint with unemployedness, and now we want to start saving up so we can eventually buy a house. It’ll probably be at <em>least</em> a year before we’ll even consider talking to the bank, but we still have to start now.So I sat here and watched other people drink this highly coveted tea, and then I COULD NOT TAKE IT ANY LONGER, <em>flails</em> AAAAAAAAARGH!!!! <em>pant pant</em>I cracked and ordered. As long as I control myself I can totally save up and buy interesting tea now and then at the same time. Besides, I was getting to that point where every time I saw someone write about it, I felt a little guilty that I hadn’t bought any myself yet. You know, having suggested that they <em>get</em> some in their shop…Okay, the actual drinking of the tea starts here!The aroma is quite mild, and it’s has a bit of a honeyed caramel-ish note to it. There’s a little bit of grain underneath too. I suspect this is a more well behaved version than the (Most Highly Beloved of All) Te Ji I get from TeaSpring. But then again, that one is pretty unruly at times, so it wouldn’t be difficult to be better behaved.Oh, so sweet! So caramel-y! There’s a bit of malt and cocoa as well, but I think it tastes mostly like sugar and caramel. I mentioned yesterday that I don’t like sugar in tea, but what I meant was that I don’t like sugar <em>added</em> to tea. When it is naturally occurring like this, I like it just fine. It has to do with the way added sugar changes the mouthfeel for me. Anyway, first sip gives my sugar-y caramel-y flavouring, and a summerly note of… <em>sip sip</em> grass?GRASS??? o.O Well, that’s new. It’s not in overwhelming amounts, though, (like what happens with most Darjeelings for me) so it doesn’t become unpleasant.Underneath that, and especially at the moment just before I swallow is the very important grain-y note. An awesome Fujian would only be half as awesome without that note. There is only one type of tea in which a good strong note of grain is more important, and that’s in Keemuns.Still, like with all the notes in here, it’s fairly calm and civilized and to my surprise I find I quite enjoy that. I mean, I love that the Te Ji tastes so riotously wild sometimes, but I’m getting older and slower, and sometimes it’s better with a tea that matches.My cup appears to have become empty… I don’t usually finish drinking before I’m finished writing. I must have needed it.That’s it. If anybody needs me further today, I’ll be in the kitchen drawing little hearts on this label.', 'Life has been going on overdrive lately. When was the last time I posted anything here? Oh my.Let me do a quick recap: (in case anyone is wondering. :)) -Week long trip to Yosemite/California vineyards turned into nursing husband back to health. It was still fun and his doctor says he’s fine now. -Husband’s friends from Germany came to visit for about 2 weeks straight after we returned home. Entertaining guests is very time consuming! But they were great and I’m glad they came. -Lost our dog, Mr. Snuggles. It was 24 hours of frantic searching, calling, flyer printing/posting, etc. Finally someone called to say she had our pup. (flyers worked!) Right after we came home with Snugs, I became violently ill. Vomiting, light headed, pounding headache. I had literally worried myself sick. But I’m ecstatic and relieved that he’s home.  -New project at work is escalating. I was informed it would entail 15 – 25% of my work time. More like 60-70%. I can’t believe I volunteered for this.  -My MIL’s 10 peach trees are exploding with fruit. It’s been non-stop canning over here. Help!Thank goodness for Labor Day! And now, I’m having a cup of tea before starting a batch of peach jam. Sigh, first world problems. This tea is as delicious as I remember. The quality especially shows now that I’ve overbrewed it and it still tastes fantastic. Smooth, hint of milk chocolate, delicious toasted grain. Mmmm… Just the boost I need for peach overload.', 'I agree with some other reviewers, that this is very delicate and light considering its a black tea. I would say its more subtle, and not at all aggressive-a relaxing tea that would be nice in the afternoon. I was pretty generous with the leaf, using 3.5 gms/8 oz water, brewing for 2 minutes, with a 2nd steep for 3 minutes. I have others that I prefer from Teavivre, such as Yun Nan Dian Hong Gold Tip or Bailin Gongfu, I think because I prefer something a little stronger, but this is still very nice, especially for those who prefer a milder tea.', 'Tea of the morning…..I know most are reviewing a free sample of this one, but since this one does not fall into the samples offered with a purchase from TeVivre (yet?) I purchased my sample. I received two 7 gram pouches for $4. I personally feel that I give a more unbiased review if I either purchase my samples, or get them with a purchase. It is just one of my quirks at this stage. As a result, I drink the tea more when I am excited about it, rather than feeling like I have to get through them. (Don’t get me wrong, though! The free samplings I received from this company in the past were integral to furthering my tea journey and I am grateful for the opportunity!)Wow. This is really good. I am on the resteep pot and it is perfect. The leaves are very golden, curly, and a bit fuzzy. By look it falls more in line with the Tan Yang Dinosara brought back from her visit to the tea district in China than other versions of this tea I have tried in the past. I was so lucky that she shared some with me. I will do a little more comparing later because I have not had that one for a while. In comparison to my other favorite Tan Yang (Tan Yang Te Ji from TeaSpring) TeaVivre’s is much more golden tipped and curlier. The leaves are also longer than the one from TeaSpring. I am pretty sure the two are of differing grades just by look with the one from TeaVivre being higher, but they are similar in price.Smooth, slight malt, super sweet (in fact, I think I need to try this one with out my usual sweetener). There is the perfect touch of earthiness wrapped in the flavor of carmelized sweet potatoes. Yes, caramel…. The TeaSpring Tan Yang is a little heavier on the malt and earthiness. I will do a ‘reminder’ cup of that also, just to be sure.So far, I am certain I will be purchasing this at some point. I wish my stash was not so overwhelming or I would buy some today. There is just such a warm sweetness with this one. Definitely sweeter than the Golden Monkey, but who should have to pick one over the other? Get them both!

Tonight was finally ideal—lots of time to relax and focus on it, and it’s bracingly cold but clear outside, the perfect time to feel grateful you’re holed up at home warm and comfy.And it was perfect. This is splendid—creamy and rich but somehow not too heavy, there’s still a lovely sense of lightness somehow. The smell is a wonderful synthesis of banana and sweetness, miles away from candy runts artificial cloyingness, somehow evoking both freshness and softness. You get the sense of the natural floral sweetness of banana and the toffee/praline is present but never overly sugary, just adds a wonderful toasted edge. Love this, feel so lucky to have had an opportunity to try it. Thank you JustJames!P.S. Forgot to mention something in my notes today…I’ve been throwing myself into Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel for the first time (I know!) thanks to a dear friend’s suggestion.

I intentionally did not look it up just to see what flavours I would discover. I could see in the blend the coconut, so I was kind of expecting a cream pie type of flavour. What I actually got was cookies. The banana flavour is quite prominent – but it’s good; it tastes like real bananas. The coconut lends a nice creaminess to the tea. I am also getting a touch of acidity.Despite the pralines eluding me the first time around, I found this delicious. I have enough leaves for another cup, and so another chance to enjoy this blend.Again, thank you so much JustJames for the sample. This was really good!', 'Thanks to <strong>James</strong> for a sample of his special tea! I was going to save it for the Dr. Who Xmas special, but was craving something a little sweet, so I drank it today instead.  It really does have layers of flavors, kind of weaving in &amp; out. It mostly reminds me of Caramel Vanilla Assam, but then here comes a hint of coconut, &amp; as it cooled I really noticed the banana, along with a cookie like taste. All in all, it’s a tasty blend, although probably not something I’d purchase, as it left me with a scratchy throat,  but still nice to sample! Thanks <strong>James</strong>!', 'Ok, so writing this tasting note just after finishing my last sip, just so that it’s all fresh in my mind.I’m so excited to finally be tearing into the package just James sent me; I do what a lot of you do, and “save” my good or excitement-worthy teas for when I’m not stressed out, able to give them my attention, or am feeling celebratory. I really need to stop doing that though, come to think of it. so many teas just sit there, waiting for “the right moment” and that’s not right, yo.So this was probably the tea i was excited for the most. In the bag, I could smell the sweet toffee, as well as the buttery creamy scent that is slightly reminiscent of Butiki’s caramel vanilla. But of course, they use the same base, and the creamy wonderfulness is Stacy’s signature anyway, so I ought not be surprised.  I tossed some cream and sugar into a cup, and set to work. I brewed for about three and a half minutes, and lifted the basket out and inhaled. The scent was spot on: I could still smell the toffee and butteriness, and if I inhaled deeply enough, a trace of coconut. And then it was just love at first sip and then some. The buttery taste of creamy caramel or assam is there, along with the sweet toffee. And as others described it, the banana makes an appearance but is by no means dominant (but I love banana, so I’ll take what I can get). You know it’s a tea you’ll want again and again when you hesitantly take your last sip because you know there isn’t too too much left. Thank you, thank you, thank you JustJames for this incredibly generous sample. And Stacy, please please say that you’ll be making this available? What will it take to convince you to do it? Please?'], 'Polarity': [0.3898550724637681, 0.33142857142857146, 0.4357142857142857, 0.3671875, 0.3416666666666666, 0.25970238095238096, 0.3219444444444444, 0.4250000000000001, 0.3055059523809524, 0.23129251700680276], 'Mouthfeel': '', 'Flavor Profile': {'Spicy': 0.625, 'Char': 0.0, 'Sweet': 0.3125, 'Nutty': 0.0625, 'Floral': 0.0, 'Herbs': 0.0, 'Vegetables': 0.0, 'Grass': 0.0, 'Wood': 0.0, 'Earth': 0.0, 'Mineral': 0.0, 'Marine': 0.0, 'Berry': 0.0, 'Citrus': 0.0, 'Tree Fruit': 0.0, 'Tropical': 0.0}}\n",

I must admit that I do prefer the original cotton candy, but this Southern Boy version is good too. Interestingly, I notice a chocolate-y tone to this toward the finish. Sweet, cotton candy-ish, and then caramel and chocolate. Quite a treat.Frank, if you’re reading this … now would be a good time for one of those blow-out type of specials that you occasionally offer. How about like 40% off orders over $80. (see, I’m going to have to resubscribe within the next couple of weeks or so) If you do, I’ll add more of the Southern Boy teas to my subscription. :)Anyway, this is very refreshing and delicious. Better than any soda!', 'I don’t make much iced tea. This became ever more apparent as I tried to brew up this new teabag from 52teas’ spin-off brand, Southern Boy Teas.The instructions say to steep the teabag in 16 oz of water. I had to look up what 16 oz was, and it turns out it’s 2 cups. Okay, now what do I have in the house that can hold this <em>gigantic</em> teabag and 2 cups of water and is preferably made out of glass, not plastic? Searching…searching…mixing bowl? I guess that’ll work. I suppose this is why people have teapots.Now I just have to measure 2 cups…AHHHHH!!!! Okay, the mixing bowl idea was not a great one. I just spilled boiling hot water on my foot. *Sigh. I was smart enough to put a dishwashing glove on my hand, so that was protected. Damn you, cute peep toe shoes!! There’s also quite a bit of water on my counter…ugh.I’m okay. No permanent damage. Now I need something to pull this gigantic teabag out of the bowl…hmm…searching…grilling tongs? And now all I need is a pitcher. I have one of those! But it’s made out of flimsy plastic and there’s no lid…hmm, that’s okay. I’ll just make a lid out of plastic wrap and a rubber band.Jeez, this is a lot of work! And I made quite a mess too. I do <em>not</em> recommend that you follow my brewing strategy. This barely worked out. I was able to pour the steeped tea from the mixing bowl into the pitcher without further incident. Now I just have to wait a couple hours for the tea to cool in the fridge.Finally, I can try it! I carefully poured myself a glass and added ice. First sip…oooh wow! This is cotton candy all right! Yum! Super delicious! Totally worth burning my foot for! :P I wanted to add a little sweetener ‘cause I’m a sweet tooth addict. I think I added a little too much so I balanced it out with more tea. :D This is sooo good, but it honestly doesn’t even need the added sugar. It’s definitely sweeter now, but the cotton candy flavor was just as apparent without it, if not more so. Delish!!', 'Our AC is on the fritz and I think this tea is keeping me sane. It is just an amazing iced tea. A perfect rich tea and then you get that cotton candy finish, and it just makes you happy. Does me anyway. The teabags make it easy too. I just put the teabag in my 2quart pitcher, pour in a bit of boiling water from my tea kettle, and three minutes later, top it off with cool water and pluck the tea bag out for round two later. (Second steep is just as awesome as the first.', 'My brother actually decided he wanted a glass of this! It’s kind of hilarious though because he said it tasted bitter at first, and I know it is not bitter at all. And he wanted a lot of agave in it…jeez.I gave some to my grandma too and she said it tasted like cherry.This probably isn’t my favorite, I prefer the regular 52teas Cotton Candy. But it’s still good, I just like the stronger cotton candy flavor. This one has more of a caramelized sugar aftertaste to it than cotton candy to me, and agave doesn’t make it pop like it does to the bubblegum SBT.That’s not to say I won’t drink this up anyway, it’s still an awesome flavor, especially since I had no idea my brother would ever touch iced tea hahaha.', 'This tea is quite amazing. It’s also kind of strange. Let me explain.Missy made a batch of this in one of our 64 oz Takeya pitchers (which I’ve highly recommended elsewhere, and will recommend again!) yesterday. The normal method of brewing it hot for three minutes in a pitcher full of hot water, adding some sugar, and tossing it in the fridge. Today, we drink!I take a drink of it today, and WOW does it taste like cotton candy! Not just sugar, but honest to goodness spun sugar, with a little bit of caramelized sugar flavor in there. Behind that, way in the distance, I could taste a little bit of the tea base.However, once it warmed up a smidge, still well under room temperature, but no longer fridge cold, the cotton candy toned down a bit and that smooth tea base had a chance to shine a little more. I don’t know if that trend would continue the warmer it got, and I never really tried the Cotton Candy black tea.So anyway, that’s what I’d say. If you want super-in-your-face cotton candy flavor, do yourself a favor and put a mug in the freezer, and pour this tea into it. If you want a more melded experience with the black tea, pour it into a normal cup and wait until it’s ~50 degrees before you drink (anecdotal, made up number based on the fact that my fridge sits at about 40 degrees).And that’s in Fahrenheit! So no getting confused and heating your iced tea to a sweaty 50 centigrade, blech!', 'Ok, so I was impressed with SBT: Razzleberry, so I ordered the other flavours to try. The plan was to brew this one up last night, then let chill in the fridge and enjoy today. All went as planned with a few detours. I boiled the water and measured it out then poured it into the pitcher. Then I ripped open the package. But when I ripped open the package, I accidentally also ripped open the tea bag inside. I panicked and just threw the whole ripped tea bag into a strainer and then into the pitcher. But the tea bag was all crumpled up in the strainer and the water wasn’t high enough to cover all the tea in the strainer. So I fished out the strainer and just put the ripped tea bag into the water. By then I don’t know how long the tea kinda steeped for. So I steeped it for 3 more minutes. Then I tried to fish out the ripped tea bag without dumping out the tea contents, but as you guessed, that didn’t work. So then I strained the tea into a different container. Had to wash out a bunch of tea out of the iced tea pitcher. Pour the tea back into the pitcher. Then added cold water and put into the fridge. So needless to say, I did not have high hopes due to my performance on this tea.But it turned out awesome! You can taste the black tea base, but there is a strong cotton candy flavour on top of the black tea. Without sugar, it was a dull cotton candy flavour, but still good. I am not a super sweet tea type of person so I thought it was ok that way. But just for iced tea authenticity I added some white sugar. With the sugar it is way more cotton candy type flavour. Not exactly what pink cotton candy tastes like, but it tastes very similar to other cotton candy flavoured things (candy, gum, drinks, etc.) that I have had before.I kept what was left of the broken tea bag, and will be re-steeping.Steeped in 16 oz boiling water for 3-ish minutes, added 2 quarts cold water.Edit: Made a resteep. It steeped well but not as good as the first time – just not as strong. I resteeped in 16 oz boiling water but added only 1 quart cold water this time.', 'Arrived home today to 3 boxes of tea. With more stuff on the way. Oy vey. I suppose I could have mentioned earlier that I am (sadly) back at home now. :(Anyways, one such box was from 52teas, because I splurged and went for the grab bag sale, and picked up some additional SBT tea bags so I could try almost all of the flavours (the rest were purchased a while back and are en route from Amanda! And I say almost all, because I have zero interest in RadioactiviTEA :P)Figured I’d give this one a shot tonight, seeing as it’s the only one I bought two of, based on the rave reviews.Brewed one giant teabag up in 2 cups of water in a pyrex measuring cup at approx. boiling for 3 minutes. So my “concentrate” needs to be diluted 1 part tea:3 parts water. I tried a bit tonight (probably the wrong proportion), and I must say that I’m definitely getting more cotton candy flavour (even lukewarm) than I got with the actual tea. It smells like spun sugar. It <strong>tastes</strong> like spun sugar. Delicious strawberry spun sugar. With a nice black tea background that’s neither bitter nor astringent. Nor too strong. This is truly a treat. I can see myself drinking through this rather quickly. I think the cup I made for myself might have been about a 1:3 mix, so I might stick with that instead of 1:4.I stuck the teabag in the fridge so I can give it a second round tomorrow, because 2 bags is probably not enough to have purchased…ETA: Had some more today and inexplicably didn’t like it as much. Must be a mood/tastebud thing. How annoying.', 'These teas are just bloody awesome really, aren’t they? I don’t know why I held off buying some last year. It was plenty hot enough in my old office to merit iced tea, although I suppose I just wasn’t up to the tea tea-buying tricks I’ve developed these days.Anyway, back to the point. I first tried the normal version of Cotton Candy in last year’s 12 Teas of Christmas sampler. I loved it. Given my success with Neapolitan Ice Cream recently, I decided to try another of the SBTs “converted” from a normal tea. (I’m not sure what it means when you start calling such oddly flavoured teas normal, but I guess it hardly matters at this point. You know what I’m on about.)This one is another stunner. If anything, the cotton candy flavouring comes out more clearly here than it does in its original counterpart. It’s delicious — sweet, sugary, airy cotton candy goodness. It smells strongly of cotton candy, it tastes strongly of cotton candy. Once again, the black base is detectabe, but it just seems to enhance and support the flavouring rather than mask it in any way.I have no idea how Frank achieves these extrodinary flavouring feats. What I do know is that, as iced tea goes, these are unbeatable. Yum yum yum is about the most coherent thing I can say about this right now. Please excuse me while I go and drink some more.', 'Perfect for summer sweetness!I made a pitcher of iced tea with this one, added some sugar and Oh my goodness does it hit the mark for cotton candy. Smells and tastes like a pink fluffy cloud of cotton candy to me. The black tea base is good too, not too strong which is nice because cotton candy is a very delicate flavor to me. Had I never found Steepster I would have never imagined cotton candy tea was out in this world. Woot! I have cotton candy matcha too!', 'I only bought one each of this one and Rainbow Sherbet, but I may get more of this one. I am DEFINITELY getting more Earl Grey Iced, or are we supposed to call it “Sorry, Captain”? And pink lemonade, more pink lemonade flavor!I made a gallon this morning and I am watching the level of the dispenser drop rapidly and steadily. Hubby is working in the chicken pen (which they don’t stay in, they free range but you still have to do some maintenance) and it is HOT and sticky. He said he likes this one better than Rainbow Sherbet, which he did like, just not as much as this one, and I think Pink Lemonade flavor is still his favorite of this year’s batch.If I bought these one at a time, I wouldn’t feel so free to make them so often, but when you buy ten at a time it really comes into line with the price of soda, which isn’t good for you and makes your teeth feel icky. Buying ten at a time, they come down to 1.99 per gallon of really delicious tea. (Autocorrect just changed delicious to devious. Frank? Is there something you’d like to tell us? &gt;grin&lt;) That is cheaper than soda unless you happen to hit a big sale. And more enjoyable. And healthier.Thank you, Frank! It is so easy to make, and you really put a lot of thought and care into your blends.

Well, for one thing I was worried I might fall asleep before dinner started!It is funny how tastes change. I never thought I would like a lapsang type tea OR a darjeeling, but thank you my Steepster friends for broadening my horizons &amp; shrinking my bank account at the same time. :))I think I made this a bit strong tonight as it seems extra dark and smoky but I am still enjoying it a lot… I still want to try cooking with lapsang one of these days!Now someone please tell me how to get the water out of my ears!', 'I don’t want to GIVE AWAY my review…but…<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUH6yvCyQvM\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUH6yvCyQvM</a>THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!I have been looking for a Lapsong Souchong JUST LIKE THIS! I FINALLY FOUND IT! Woot! Woot! Woot!!!!I was looking for something with the strong smokey scent and was smoky to taste but didn’t have a funky after taste or too over the top while actually drinking it. I was also looking for one that didn’t taste like wood and was smooth. This is it! This just seems to have EVERYTHING I have been looking for in a smoky tea. I’m shocked…SHOCKED!!!!Now…if you are one of those people who are the “more smokey tasting the better” this might not be strong enough in taste for you.

What a way to start the new year. We arose to temps dipping to 10 below outside and our oil heater had quit during the night. The house was freezing. Hubby went out to fix it (yes, the problem was outside in lines or something) He bundled up and went to grab the door knob and it shattered and fell apart in his hand! No, we do not use glass door knobs and no my husband is not the Hulk. So, we both looked at each other shocked and now there was a gaping round hole in our door allowing the evil cold in. We shoved a rag in the door and went out and I huddled around an electric heater in the house. After a bit, I decided that I would start some laundry because the dryer would help heat up the house. SO, tossed laundry in the washing machine and then decided to shower and get ready for the day. THEN, while in the shower, the washing machine water <em>backs up into the tub</em>. The water keeps coming, so I have to shut off the shower water and huddle on a ledge with a towel around me, shivering and of course, shampoo in my hair (nothing ever happens just after you rinsed your hair, does it?) Finally, the water went down and I was able to shower. SO, my whole point that this was just our first hour of New Years Day! I needed a good tea to counteract this craziness. I opened up my tea sample drawer and grabbed this and dumped the rest of it that was left in my tea infuser (about a teaspoon and half). I needed its wonderful strength yet, polite gentleman like qualities to give me courage for the rest of the day. Whew! Thank you Amy Oh and Thank you Hu Kwa. Read previous note for on this tea. Oh, and Happy New Year…I guess.', 'Tea of the morning…. (SRP #43)This is the end of my sample of this tea, and I loved it while I had it. Thank you, again, narwhalclub!It is probably about the smokiest I could handle, but it is very good with a little sweetner. I do have others that I like better that have a slightly smoother, more cocoa-noted base, so I will probably stick with one of them for the future.

Look at that canister-it look a hundred years old! I only hoped the tea was new.The bad thing about Wendell is their shipping is comparatively high (for tea merchants) and (as far as I can tell) you have to buy 4 ounces of most everything. However, I really enjoy Lapsang, and with all the good reviews, I figured there was little chance that I wouldn’t like this tea. The <strong>good</strong> thing about Wendell is that their 4 ounce teas come in their own tins-no looking for a tin and struggling to remove the scent of the previous tea-you are ready to go. The tins have their lids attached on back hinges and are <strong>filled to the brim</strong> so be careful not to spill any. And to be fair about the shipping, the tins are probably a little more expensive to ship than a pouch.The dry leaves are medium in length, very tightly rolled, and mostly chocolate brown with some mahogany brown mixed in. I’ve gone into sensory overload comparing the dry leaf aroma of this to my other Lapsangs, so descriptors fail me now, but suffice to say it is unique compared to the others. It’s smoky of course, but spicy too, and I’ll leave it at that for now. Liquor is copper-colored and very clear.Flavor is smoky and mild. Slightly sweet. Very smooth. It tastes like a Lapsang, but slightly different. Perhaps that is the Formosan base instead of a Chinese tea base? Perhaps they have a better technique of smoking their leaves. Maybe both. No matter, it’s delicious. Almost makes me long for 90 degree days-when I enjoy Lapsang the most. I have 6 Lapsangs in my house right now. 5 of them are one ounce or less, so Hu Kwa will be around long after I have finished the others-and I kinda like that.', 'A cool foggy morning, waiting for the sun to shine and enjoying a gut-warming cup of one of my faves.

Yes, the smoke is heavy, but it isn’t overpowering, and good wood and tea were used. This tastes like, erm, barbeque tea. Delicious!', 'I have been buying this tea since the 1960’s and as far as I’m concerned it is the absolute best Lapsang Souchong tea there is. Over the years it has not deviated even slightly from its excellence. In comparison to other Lapsang Souchongs, many are far too strong and the tar taste is too intense. Hu-Kwa strikes the perfect balance with that wonderful smoky flavor and a hardy deep amber brew that warms your body and soul on a cold morning. This tea is simply the best…', 'Hu Kwa is purported to be the top-notch Lapsang Souchong from Taiwan. Steeping one cup at a time, I use one teaspoon of leaves per cup, and I steep the tea for five and a half minutes in just-boiled water, as per Mark T. Wendell Tea Company’s website. The dry leaves have a very strong smokiness to them, as is normal with Lapsang Souchong. However, with this one, there is a slight undertone of sweetness that can be noticed in the dry leaves. The aroma of the steeped tea is also quite smooth. Past experience with Lapsang Souchong has exposed me to some that were so rough as to suggest that perhaps one should be sitting outside on the ground around a campfire while drinking them, not sipping this noble drink in a more civilised setting.The five and a half minutes is up, so I decant the tea to remove the leaves and allow the tea a minute or so to cool slightly (scalded taste buds do not make for accurate tea tasting). Heavily smoked is a good descriptor of the taste, but not overly smoked. That strange line of sweetness that went through the scent of the dry leaves is still present in the tea itself. The smoothness of this tea made it quite enjoyable to drink. Smooth and not thick.

I may re-stock this tea instead of the straight Laoshan Black, yes, that’s how delicious it was.ETA: Round three was steeped for quite a while (probably more than 5 minutes) and is mostly kind of burny-toasty.

I don’t know that I won’t be restocking as soon as I finish this note.Prep notes: 2.5 tsp. leaf to 10 oz. water with some milk at the below parameters.I remember how this one tasted before with just milk so I replicated it today. I don’t get as much chocolate, more of the rice/starchy notes, but the texture still wins all the points. Thick and creamy and decadent. My favorite.A really nice way to start my early morning.', 'Sipdown, 128. I had a little more than I would normally use left in the pouch, so of course this is overleafed. I reduced the steep time to compensate but it is still a tad stronger than I would prefer.A tasty tea, but I’m glad I only picked up an ounce of it. For me, I don’t need any wuyi oolong in my Laoshan Black. :)', 'Does it count as a sipdown if I only finished off one bag because my other arrived in the mail today? If so, then SIPDOWN! If not, well, then this will never be sipped down. I love this tea. I think even more than the Laoshan Black. Yum.<strong>ETA</strong> drinking this while eating a peanut butter cookie Lara bar. Match made in heaven. Tastes like a gourmet peanut butter cup. I gotta go buy more Lara bars. Holy snikes.', 'Well, I couldn’t wait until I got home to try this one. The beau is not one for chocolate teas either so I doubt he’ll be bothered. The aroma of the dry leaves makes me think of a Crunch or Krackle bar – chocolate with some puffed rice. The beany malty laoshan black sits underneath all that, holding it together.I went a bit light on the leaf but gave it extra time to balance out. I remember Laoshan Black as being strong on flavour under most circumstances so I am confident it can handle it. The liquor is a warm sunflower sort of yellow, with strong malt aroma that is tinged with cocoa at the end. I’ve always loved the idea of a genmaicha, but being a hater of green tea I have never really enjoyed it. This could be the way for me!!First sips yield a fairly typical laoshan flavour. Heavy on malt with some cocoa and honeyed sweetness on the end of the sip. The nibs are working with the natural cocoa flavours of the tea and bringing it out even more. I love that. So far there is nothing here that screams toasted rice for me though. I will report back in a bit to see if that changes but for now this is mostly laoshan with chocolate, and I ain’t complainin’. :)EDIT: I have had the new batch of Laoshan Black and I must say that I prefer the unadulterated Laoshan Black to this blend. I get much more cocoa from the Laoshan Black than from this one and I prefer the intensity of flavour. I think the addition of the oolong here (while nice) detracts from what I love about the Laoshan. Still yummy though!', 'Once again, I do not taste chocolate at all in this, although I’m finding that a lot with just cacao nibs in a great many ‘chocolate’ teas.On the other hand laoshan black genmaicha (without any chocolate) just hits the spot. I love the toasty rice and I love laoshan black and it’s just good. It just is. I added way more tea than normal because I couldn’t remember if this was 1 tsp per ‘cup’ or 2. 6 tsp to about 850ml water. Really strong and roasty toasty. Lovely. Now to scarf it down before I have to run out the door.Kitten wants some love, he’s trying to type for me.', 'I like laoshan black. I like chocolate. And I like genmaicha. Put them all together and you get something that I would probably like. When you add oolong to that, you get something that is not for me. I wish I had looked more carefully at this tea and what it was made of because I was not expecting any oolong until I got a taste of it in my first sip. I am getting a nuttiness and chocolate and a whole lot of oolong. I had such high hopes but the oolong is really ruining this for me. Thank you for sharing <strong>Dexter3657</strong> alas I feel as though I have wasted this by not being more aware of what I was asking for. I am sorry.', 'Another part of my Verdant birthday order. Y’know, I’d forgotten what genmaicha was when I placed this order, but I was so lured in by the promise of comforting flavors that I didn’t even give it a second thought. Had my first sip in a thermos on the way to an early doctor’s appointment, and then made some more for the morning mug at home.Mmmm. Mmmmmmmm. I’m glad I’ve had the chance to try and get used to the regular Laoshan black before this, because that flavor had a bit of an adjustment period to me. Now that I crave LB, this is tasty. Normally I don’t do roasty, but I don’t mind it in this context. It’s quite a forgiving tea, too; I accidentally left a bit in the bottom of the teapot for a couple of hours and it was still great.Really, I just wanna sip on this all day.

The level of depth and richness in this is beyond words…but I tried :) - Pure decadence, this black tea blend is packed full of deep creamy cocoa notes! My goal for this tea was to bring the ice cream shop on Mackinac Island into your cup! I began with North Winds – our black tea with dessert notes inspired by the island’s famous fudge. The next step was to seek out the highest quality vanilla beans in the world, hand chop them and blend them into the base tea. Blended with a careful hand and the utmost respect for letting all of the flavors shine, this tea exceeds all expectations!Golden Orchid carries a rich and exceedingly smooth body with a perfectly balanced flavor profile. Unlike many other vanilla black teas, our base tea shines through the vanilla, creating a mouthwatering synthesis of bold and smooth dessert notes. While the vanilla is noticible by the trained palette, it does more than just add the depth of vanilla notes. Our premium (grade A) vanilla beans sourced from the island of Madagascar accentuate the deep fudge and cocoa notes of the base tea as well as add a thick creamy aspect to the tea, reminiscent of masterfully-crafted dark chocolate. The fruity notes of the tea are ever present, too, with light notes of plum and a mouthwatering layer of dark-chocolate covered Michigan cherries! This tea extends far past the last drop, with the flavor of melted chocolate and sweet vanilla lingering for hours. We recommend enjoying Golden Orchid with shortbread cookies or breakfast pastry’s for the ultimate experience. Click here for our gluten-free shortbread recipe!Over time, the tea will absorb the vanilla notes and smooth out. We recommend drinking this tea once or twice a week to taste the way it transforms over time. Also note that mixing up the tea prior to scooping out your desired amount of leaf is recommended due to the tendency of the vanilla beans to sink to the bottom of the bag. Enjoy!Notes Fudge Dark Chocolate Dried Cherries Vanilla Pluot Honey Malt', 'I absolutely love Brendan’s North Winds and this is it with Vanilla in the mix, what a wonderful creation. Notes of Smooth Chocolate and Creamy Vanilla are just OMG so good, If you are a fan of North Winds you will prolly like this one alot too. The Vanilla in this one is just amazing, it is the perfect compliment to the dark chocolate and malty notes that this tea carries, it makes for a very smooth creamy sweet delight.  Brenden mentions an Ice Cream shop on Mackinac Island in his description on this one, tho I have never been in that particular shop, I have to say that he hit the mark with that statement. When you walk into an Ice Cream Shop and you get a whiff of the Vanilla ice cream they are making in the back combined with the sweet scents that you get from the other ice creams and candies, you can very easily compare that to the aromas that you get from this one. That is a very comforting and welcoming aroma that just makes you feel good. The taste OMG totally matches the aroma, what you smell is what you actually taste and that is a wonderful thing that don’t happen often enough.  As I’m writing this I’m sipping and trying to think of more write but alls i can think is “oh Vanilla, you are so good to me” It’s amazing how good the Vanilla in this tea is, this is no nasty vanilla flavoring that leaves a funky film in your mouth, it is real and clean and creamy sweet goodness that you only get from real Vanilla Beans. I can’t say enough good things about this one, it is delicious to me just like Brenden’s other blends I just can’t get enough.Oh Yeah, after the tea is steeped out the Vanilla keeps going, very interesting and very good :)I’ll be order lots of this one for as long as it is available :)', 'Great test amazing flavor.

The first time, I followed the brewing guidelines on the package. (NB: I brew Western style.) The tea was unremarkable. I tasted very little vanilla, but perhaps I didn’t stir the contents of the tea pouch enough.I brewed a second batch (new leaves, well-stirred) using my traditional brewing method, 212F at 2:00 minutes. The tea was actually bitter and made me belch. I’m really sorry about that, because, at $10/oz., this was a rather pricey failed experiment. However, I gave the rest of it to my friend, who loves it, so an ill wind and so on.', 'I’m continuing to clear out the backlog with this one. It took longer than expected for me to get to this tea. I was aware that it was very popular and had a great reputation here on Steepster, and I think that may have played a role in my initial lack of desire to review it. Everyone had already said so much about this particular blend, what, if anything could I add? Well, now I am finally getting around to reviewing this blend and I have to say that I found it to be incredible. I have long felt that some of the best offerings from Whispering Pines Tea Company are their blends and my experience with this one only further reinforced that opinion.I prepared this tea gongfu style. After a flash rinse, I steeped 6 grams of the loose blended material in 4 ounces of 205 F water for 5 seconds. This infusion was chased by 14 subsequent infusions. Steep times for these infusions were as follows: 7 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, 1 minute, 1 minute 15 seconds, 1 minute 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes.Prior to the rinse, I detected aromas of vanilla, chocolate, honey, spices, and stone fruits. After the rinse, I found new aromas of raisin, malt, orange, leather, and wood. The bouquet of the first infusion was practically identical. I found mild notes of vanilla, malt, cream, wood, and chocolate in the mouth. Subsequent infusions brought out orange, black cherry, raisin, toast, leather, honey, plum, and mineral notes. I also found touches of camphor on the finish. When I focused in, I could detect additional notes of baked bread, clove, anise, nutmeg, menthol, and eucalyptus as well. The later infusions primarily offered mineral, baked bread, toast, cream, malt, and wood notes underscored by fleeting impressions of vanilla and calming, cooling herbal notes.When I first tried this, it took me a couple minutes to adjust to it. I think I was expecting it to be much sweeter than it was, but fortunately, this was a very balanced, complex blend with a wonderful mix of aromas and flavors. The vanilla never came close to overpowering what the tea base had to offer. Instead, they complimented one another beautifully. Furthermore, I greatly appreciated the fact that no artificial ingredients were used in this blend. Overall, I have a hard time imagining that there is a much better vanilla black tea blend on the market. Definitely make a point of trying this one.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Anise, Baked Bread, Camphor, Cherry, Chocolate, Clove, Cream, Eucalyptus, Honey, Leather, Menthol, Mineral, Nutmeg, Orange, Plums, Raisins, Toast, Vanilla, Wood\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'delicious.. i love it…', '\\nThis was a delight to the senses!

Anyway, I was generous with the amount of leaves I used, and I let it steep a bit longer than usual, but the result of the first steep was still great. The tea is blacker than my ex’s heart, but very warming when you actually take a sip. The flavor is intensely malty, with some nice cinnamon undertones, which results in a pleasant tingling sensation that lingers on the tongue for about two minutes. It’s a very intense experience, and was perfect for waking me up (I’m barely sentient until I have my caffeine). Anyway, this tea pairs well with my music and my activities (reading a bunch of books and articles to study for finals), so I’m really glad that I picked it for today.The second infusion is still malty, but the cinnamon as gotten more prominent, the taste has sweetened a great deal, and the overall experience is smoother. The aftertaste has a smooth, almost-mineral quality to it. It’s like the tea is starting to become creamy, but it isn’t quite there yet. This is probably due to how strong I brewed the tea, but I’m certain that the next cup will have the creamy goodness that I remember. In the mean time, I’m going to enjoy the current flavor as much as possible.The third infusion is malty, creamy, and a touch spicy due to the cinnamon flavor. There’s no linen (not that I’ve ever tasted the illusive linen flavor of this tea before), and the citrus flavors hasn’t made an appearance yet. Regardless, it is a well-balanced cup of tea, where the flavors harmonize quite well. On a side note, I switched my music over to J. S. Bach’s <strong>Das Musikalische Opfer</strong>, a delightfully complex piece of music to complement the tea’s development. My recording is even better because it is a Historically Informed recording, played on period instruments with a tuning system that Bach preferred. The end result is an astounding. Anyway, the tea is getting more complex, and it’s various flavors mesh together well to create something greater than the sum of its parts.', 'Ahh… I think I shall be sipping on this tea for a while, because I want to enjoy the many infusions that the description promises. This tea is so delicious. The first infusion is sweet and tastes like honey. There are mere hints of a smoky, spicy background that is masked by this sweetness. These background notes peek out every once in a while, just to let me know they are there, and enticing me to continue to sip so that I can move on to my next infusion and taste more.To my recollection, this is the first tea that I’ve tried from Verdant, and it’s solid gold! I love it.', '<strong>MY ORDER FROM VERDANT TEA CAME AND I CAN’T EVEN CONTAIN MY EXCITEMENT!</strong>Included in the package were the four teas that David generously let me custom pick for a sampler pack, a generously sized sample of the Wuyi Mountain Big Red Robe, and a nice handwritten note from David! Verdant is truly such a wonderful company and I can’t wait to order from them in the future!I got my package last night on my way home from a Fair Trade event that I hosted at our school with the Environmental Club (it was pretty successful, a good number of people came!) and my mom handed me this package in the car! I freaked and ripped it open (in the car :P) with the cap to a soda bottle (one of the ones that are reminiscent of a beer bottle)! Obviously I couldn’t try them at 9 at night, so I had to wait until now to try them! I picked this one because a black tea always makes sense to me in the morning.Dry, this one smells so good! It’s got kind of a peppery scent, with a sweet aroma somewhere in the mix! I followed the directions and used a tablespoon and a half of leaves for my cup. I used a bottle of filtered spring water for this because I’m a firm believer that high quality teas should be made with pure, untainted water. Steeped, the aroma is very similar, but a honey like scent has come out. The color is a really nice golden amber. This is a fine example of a beautiful cup of tea.The first steep is yummy! A nice honey taste is present and there’s a slight spiciness in the background, crawling around. It’s a bit dry on the swallow, but a nice juiciness arises just before the finish. Alright, I’m breaking down and adding a little bit of honey to this for good measure! I didn’t add too much, but OH MY GOD! This is delicious! I agree with every other review-this tastes like you’re drinking honey candies! I’m not generally a fan of pure honey, but this is so nice! Sweet and then there’s still that spicy note in the background. This is delicious. Truly liquid gold.Second Steep-Boiling water for 3 and a half minutes. OMNOMNOMNOMNOM! This one is so good! Even better than the first! The honey is more subdued and the other flavors come out more! There’s still as nice lingering sweetness, and the astringency has all but disappeared! This is very good!

Brewed basket style with generous leaf: This tea after 3 minutes of steeping is all sweet honey with spicy cinnamon cream. Hints of soft cocoa. I will be enjoying this rest of the day. I have to increase the score….', 'This tea is my least favourite of Verdant’s black tea offerings. That’s not to say that there’s anything wrong with it, but I love different, intriguing flavours in straight blacks (if I’m going to drink them), and this one is simply too reminiscent of a bagged black tea. It is clearly infinitely better than bagged, but the flavour profile is similar, there is no overwhelming sweetness, no chocolatey notes. Perhaps I should have gone with the recommended 3 minute infusion instead of 1.5 to bring out more flavour (I have lots left and can try this later), but I don’t think the flavours I’m looking for will be present.', 'Where to begin?First…this is FAB!But this is also DIFFERENT…but in a GOOD way! Here are my thoughts…Most Yunnan Golden Buds I have tried are very strong – some cigar like, some super malty, some have even a grainy texture.Verdant’s are smoother, creamier, not cigar-like – it’s sweeter and I can taste the honey notes the product description mentioned! It’s quite nice!Multiple infusions!!!!!! More notes coming soon!', 'I know I just complained about drinking hot tea, but I just have so many new samples from generous Steepsterites that I can’t resist!! So, I cranked up the A/C, and now it’s time for some hot tea! Woot! :DThis one in particular is verrrrrry exciting! I thought it was Golden Fleece, but it’s actually Yunnan Golden Buds. Which means I received yet another awesome Yunnan Verdant tea from <strong>Kittenna</strong>!! You rock!The brewed tea aroma is resplendent! Can I say that to describe a tea? I think so. Resplendent!!! After the first sip, I sighed with pleasure. This tea is just…I’m speechless. It’s just incredible. Amazing. It has natural notes of cocoa and malt with some honey thrown in for good measure. Sooooo good!!!!It’s a good thing I’m home alone, because this tea is evoking some salacious sounds from me, hehehe. ;) I was originally planning on steeping the Golden Fleece right after this to compare the two. But now I kind of want to hoard it, haha! The second steep for 2.5 minutes is just as delicious as the first! Nearly identical, only slightly milder and smoother.I’m probably gonna’ go for at least four infusions here.

Each infusion 3 minutes. 1TB Leaves used per instructions on the Verdant Website Per Cup. traditional method (PIAO 1 glass pot used).<strong>1.</strong> Beautiful medium golden brown (with a twinge of green) colored liquor. There is a very pronounced honey scent that picked me up and carried me away…I mean it…all through this first tasting…to my crazy place! (You should all be afraid!) I went to my cupboard and pulled out some honey. Buckwheat honey…yuk…not that one…too strong. Then the local Prairie Wildflower Raw honey (Copoco)…which was closer to the scent( I’ll get back to this later). I needed to taste this tea! The flavor reminds me of those honey seseme candies…but slightly astringent on the finish. Juicy and bright.<strong>2.</strong> This I was hoping would be the <strong>‘MegaMillion’ Pour</strong>. Soooo much darker! Rich and silky looking caramel orange liquor. The same color that you don’t want your tanning lotion to do to your body! This smells like a slightly floral honey…here we go folks…that Prairie Wildflower Honey! Sumptious and bright on the tongue! Juicy! I just HAD…yes HAD to add sweetening to see what would happen to the honey and it was the best thing I ever ate. No, that’s a show…but it was so darned good! That sweet addition brought up the cinnamon and spicy pepperiness which made a huge difference to the whole cuppa experience. I have to say that when I finished this second cup, there was a feeling and coating on my tongue like whipped creamy honey thick and gooey.<strong>3.</strong> The liquor is getting lighter now but still nice and amber. What to expect here? No floral notes but still some honey flavor exists. What is so pronounced at this stage is cinnamon and pepper. If you are a spice-aholic…this is where you jump for joy and say <strong>“Mama Mia! \"</strong>  (I’m thinking Verdant is going to bar me from writing comments about their tea!)How fantastic to have honey and cinnamon in your tea without having to add it! It’s there already naturally! This is worth a try!', 'I’m brewing this western-style since I only have one gaiwan, and I’m using it for oolongs. I hear you are only supposed to use a gaiwan for one type of tea?First steep: Wowww, this is so good! My only other encounter with a Yunnan black tea was Davids wild yunnan or something, and it tasted like baked goods, like soft pretzels or something. This is like that too, only with more natural sweetness and a strong honey note. The aftertaste gives me the impression of a very dark chocolate. I haven’t had a cup of tea this nice in awhile.Second steep: This cup doesn’t have as much of an aroma as the first one did, but the taste is just as intense. The baked goods taste is still there, and the sweetness, but less honey. I think I like this steep better actually! There’s something almost cakey about it, and I can pick up a bit of the cinnamon people were talking about.I know this would be good for a couple more steeps, but I have to go to work :C MASSIVE SADNESS.', 'Way to go, Uniquity. This is another tea that I have been hoarding/savouring since ordering it from Verdant. 1.5 years ago. I have another order dreamed up and am just waiting to see if a co-worker wants in so I am really feeling compelled to finally drink up the beautiful teas I got last time. Despite it’s age this has been stored well (score!) and maintains a lovely sweet yunnan smell. I’m thinking more hay than pepper or cocoa. I am likely in a better position now to appreciate this tea than I was when I bought it, so this is for the best, right? :)Steeped for 3.5 minutes, the beau and I shared a pot while he finishes Silent Hill Downpour. He’s been finishing it for days, but who am I to judge? I’m the “just one more page/chapter/book” girl. After pouring the tea, I even gave a bit to my tea pet (also from Verdant way back when). Aren’t I generous? Steeped, this almost puts me in mind of chocolate cake. It smells rich, sweet and decadent. Sweet hay remains a strong aroma.First sips are clean and sweet, not as bold as other yunnans but very tasty. I get some light cocoa, and the sweet hay continues to dominate. For now I am going to sit back and enjoy it. Then maybe steep it again. Mmmmm. I think this is one of those teas that would be impossible to over-steep.

I’ll be exploring black, green, oolong, and chai teas. Thanks to Vahdam Tea’s sampler packs, I have a pretty diverse selection of quality teas.So, I couldn’t bring myself to follow their brewing recommendations and brew Western style. WIth only 10g to work with, I had to go gong fu – once with about 6g in 150ml gaiwan, and another with 4g in a 60ml gaiwan. Yes – full on gong fu.I have to say – this tea was made for gong fu brewing. Not only did both of my sessions yield substantially different results, but the heavily-leafed version (4g/60ml) was extraordinarily dynamic and revealed new facets with just the slightest changes in brewing parameters. It was simply a FUN tea to brew. (As a side note – the 6g/150ml version had more grape leaf flavors, while the 4g/60ml version had some almond, yeast roll, and pollen. Both had rich and syrupy finishes).The flavors ranged from fruity to vegetal, from floral to sweet, with herbs, spices, and even baked goods making an appearance. Really fun, and on par with Taiwanese high-mountain oolongs. However, just like these oolongs, I can’t say that I would ever purchase anything more than a sample – at $38 for 100g, it is simply out of my budget for what I pay for tea. But, it is well worth adding a sample to my cart just to remind myself of the kinds of experiences that are available out there in the world of tea. * Dry leaf: primary grape leaf note. Secondary notes of light roasted nut, parsley, cilantro, and sassafras. Hints of anise. In preheated vessel – more nut flavors, buttery syrupiness.Smell: sweet corn, light pecan, grape leaf, floral, yeast rollTaste: arrival of grape leaf. Development of raw almond, yeast roll, pollen, and coriander seed. Finish is syrupy sweet. Aftertaste of sweet corn, parsley, and hints of sassafras.', 'This tea was an all-around pleasure to drink.The dried leaves were whole, mostly golden tips, and rolled well.I steeped 4 grams of tea in 12 ounces of near-boiling water for 4 minutes.The color of the liquor was like a wheat pilsner—very light, pale yellow.The aroma was floral, but undefined further than that. The floral aroma translated also into the flavor, along with hay and a slight muscatel flavor.Overall, it is an excellent 1st flush Darjeeling—one that I’d <strong>like</strong> to keep in stock on my shelves for days when I am in the mood for a 1st flush. Given the nature of the tea, though, I don’t think it would have a long shelf life. Plus, the price is a bit high for me to make this a regular brew.<i>NOTE: My tea had a date of picking of 08 April 2017</i>\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Floral, Hay, Muscatel\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'I wrote a review for this tea last night and tried to post it at least four separate times, but it got eaten each time. Steepster was hungee!!! Anyway, this was another of the samples that Vahdam Teas so kindly sent to me. I had long been aware that the Arya Tea Estate was one of the most consistently acclaimed tea producers in Darjeeling, but until I tried this tea, I had yet to try any of the teas produced by this estate. If this one was representative of their offerings, I guarantee I will be trying more soon.I prepared this tea Western style. I steeped 3 grams of loose tea leaves in 8 ounces of 194 F water for 5 minutes. I did not attempt any additional infusions.Prior to infusion, the dry tea leaves emitted a pronounced Muscatel aroma underscored by grass and sweet corn. After infusion, I again picked up a strong Muscatel scent balanced by sweet corn and grass, but this time I also picked up nice aromas of citrus, malt, herbs, and peach. In the mouth, there was a strong Muscatel note from the entry to the swallow. Notes of white peach, tangerine, sweet orange, grass, herbs, malt, cream, honey, and sweet corn provided balance. The fade offered lingering traces of Muscatel underpinned by citrus, honey, grass, sweet corn, and malt.This was a seriously impressive offering. Of the first flush Darjeelings I have tried, this one probably offered the clearest and strongest Muscatel presence. Fortunately, there was a lot more to this tea than that. I would recommend this one highly to those looking for a sweet, fruity first flush Darjeeling with a well-defined Muscatel character.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Citrus, Corn Husk, Cream, Grass, Herbs, Honey, Malt, Muscatel, Orange, Peach\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'This is a very tasty tea.

I reached way in the back of my tea cabinet and pulled out my beloved Golden Tips that I was saving. It has a 3 year shelf life and I have a number of boxes of samples yet to be reviewed. Getting through all of them will take a long time. I don’t care. I am going to drink that which was too valuable to open.As I opened the bag it was heaven – cocoa, sweet potato, malt. I used a healthy pinch of leaf, then reached in and got more. No scrimping. No saving. Not today. I am going to enjoy my tea. I used my clear glass teapot. I’ve never used it before with a black tea. I was rewarded with one of the most spectacular ballets I have had the pleasure of watching in ages.When I went to pour, things took a nasty turn. I wasn’t paying attention. The lid slipped off the pot (normally I have a finger on it) and smacked the spout knocking it cleanly off. As upset as I am that my favorite teapot is broke, I am more concerned about the cup I was about to enjoy and the leaf that is in the bottom of the pot that would resteep the rest of the day. But you know what, I have more and I’m not afraid to use it!I am now looking for a replacement clear glass teapot. I had this one <a href=\"http://www.enjoyingtea.com/caseafiglte.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.enjoyingtea.com/caseafiglte.html</a> Previously I accidentally bumped it while cleaning and it had a hairline crack along the top of the spout. Today’s mishap broke cleanly across the spout in the other direction, so the two are unrelated. Much as I loved this one I am thinking I might try one with more of a kettle spout.Now go grab something you are saving and drink it! Just keep your finger on the lid.', 'Tea of the morning…..I am down to the dregs of my first 50 grams of this tea. (Luckily, my pack rat tendencies had me purchase 100 grams from the outset!) It is wonderfully caramelly, sweet potatoey, with a bit of maltiness. I love this one. And I am enjoying my crisp, nearly-summer morning before the wheels get rolling.Usual teapot method.', 'I waited to pick the third tea for my guest until I had seen her try shu puerh and jasmine silver needle. I used her opinions to pick the final tea, and was leaning toward black tea since she loved the puerh but it had to be just the right one since she had been scared off by a bitter black tea someone else gave her. I called in youngest to help with suggestions. She said, “What about the one we had last week that was so good?”I turned to my friend and asked, “Do you like sweet potatoes?” “I LOVE SWEET POTATOES!” It was almost a roar! I laughed and pulled this pouch of tea.This time I got out my tray and tiny teapot with a fair cup. We’d had two teas western style, now she could see gong fu style!She smelled the liquor and was astonished at the remarkable scent of sweet potatoes, so distinctive. She sipped and said, “This is it! This is my favorite. I liked the others a lot, but this one is perfect. I could drink this all the time.”She is right. It is a remarkably good tea and I am getting a little low. So I guess that is one more to add to my next order.', 'It’s been a busy day, so no real tasting notes on this, but I’ve reviewed it plenty of times. It’s a lovely buttery rich brew, no astringency, smooth &amp; sweet, &amp; I can drink it on an empty stomach whilst contemplating what to have for breakfast, &amp; that’s what I did this morning.', 'Tea of the morning. I was getting more caramel notes today than usual. Maybe it’s because I used close to 3 tsp of leaf. I still have a little bit of this sample left, so I will have to try over leafing again to see if I can re-create the delicious caramel notes Resteep was just about as good', 'Many thanks to Teavivre for this generous sample!Oh, this one is fantastic! Gentle, golden, BRIGHT sweet potatoes! I’ve had only one other of this type of tea, and in comparison, this has a bit of…orange? to it. Sort of like you put a touch of orange juice in your baked sweet potatoes? And let me also emphasize the word baked. There is definitely some sort of delicious crust to this ;) This is one special unflavored, delicious exactly as nature produced it tea!!!!I have to also add that the leaves are so fluffy and gorgeous! They smell so wonderful, too.Rumor has it that this is an excellent resteeper, and what good timing – I am in the mood for steep after steep today! Off to make some more water :) This is GREAT!', 'Sample sip down! One of the teas I brought with me that arrived before I left for the cottage that I took so that I wouldn’t have to add them to my cupboard ha! This is a really nice black that I. Happy to have tried. Theres a smoothness to it that I quite like.', 'I got a new round of tea samples from the wonderful Angel at <strong>Teavivre</strong>. This is the first one from the new set and I decided to actually write down the steeps in my journal before logging them into Steepster. It was fun actually writing down a tea tasting in my neon pink ink.<strong>Steep 1:</strong> Brewed for two minutes. The tea smells dark and the liquor is a deep warm brown. The first taste is more earth and then a slightly sweet taste creeps in along the sides of your tongue. I looked at the tea packet and saw that it suggested a lower water temperature than I used so I am going to try a lower water temperature with the next steep and see if that changes things.<strong>Steep 2:</strong> Brewed for 2.5 minutes. The liquor is slightly paler, but not by that much. It looks more like a dark topaz. It smells slightly like a sweet potato that has been taken out of the dirt and then quickly sprayed off so that it is clean but bits of earth are still clinging to the skin.The taste is amazing. A very faint cocoa note that mixes with the previous taste to make an amazing slightly sweet rye bread. The kind that is just out of the oven. The crust is crisp and the crumb (the soft part of the bread) is so soft that it deflates in your mouth and releases a burst of flavor. So delicious.<strong>Steep 3:</strong> Brewed for 3.5 minutes. The liquor is a light bronze. The flavor of rye bread is still there but it has a slight sweet potato taste to it now. This steep is a little watery, but I think if I had brewed it for another minute it would have been better. This is the last steep for the night.Overall, this tastes very different from the full leaf version, but I love that it is so different. It just tastes good and makes me think of a warm kitchen when I was little. My mom doesn’t like rye bread so she never made it, but she did make bread. I can let my imagination fill in that it tasted like this tea and I would be content wherever I was at the moment. Delicious.', 'Okay, something crazy has happened to me. Ever since I had that extraordinary cup of Laoshan Black, I’ve been craving a cup of black tea every morning. It’s crazy! I’ve never been a huge fan of black teas! Especially not unflavored and unsweetened black teas. The world has gone insane! Insaaaane!So because I’ve never had this fondness for black teas, I have no black teas in my collection. None! I wake up this morning with a craving for a black tea knowing that I probably have none. With I sigh, I rummage through my samples to find a puerh or dark oolong or something else that might be like black tea. Then I come upon this sample from Teavivre! I’ve sampled this tea before and couldn’t find anything special about it. At the time, it just tasted like black tea. Whatevs.But today! Today was different! The leaves smell so sweet and pastry like! Like a biscuit! And the flavor! I definitely am finding that baked sweet potato everyone is talking about! Tasty! Sweet potatoes baked with a touch of honey and and dash of spice! What a lovely fall tea! Now I have a whole category of tea to be obsessed about! And I will need more tea to add to my stash! Halp!Gotta move this rating up from 70. 70! What was I thinking?!Edit: Might I just add this this tea is perfect with a holiday morning breakfast of amaretto matcha brownies. Yes, brownies can be for breakfast because I’m an adult now! Sorry Mom!', 'Has anyone else tried this in a gaiwan? I forgot I had it, and so I got it out for some gaiwan steeping.I also paid no attention to how long it was going. I’m gonna guess 10 seconds for the first steep, because I counted to 15 for the second.It’s so sweet! I don’t really taste anything other than sweetness in this, but it’s soooo good. Like sparkling sugar.I ended up steeping this a total of 7 times in the gaiwan. None of the steeps were as good as the first two. I am not sure I like gaiwan steeping for this tea because it loses out on that baked sweet potato taste. I could smell it in the 4th steep at least, although it was very citrusy/orange. But it didn’t translate into the taste at all.Oh well. I also got a sample of more of this in my last Teavivre order because I wasn’t paying attention at all.

It was meant to be.With the rain pouring down outside and a day that was going to be spent alone with no plans, the arrival of my Verdant tea was extra joyful. David (the owner of Verdant) put a little something extra inside my shipment besides the regular sample for me to try which brought a tear to my eye. The kindness of strangers as they say. More and more the people I encounter on Steepster, and several tea providers, are less like strangers and are individuals that I care about. Thank you!I was determined NOT to do a complicated long review of this tea.  I followed the instructions on the Verdant site for Western Style preparation because it was later in the day when my tea arrived. Using Spring water I could count on a great pot of tea.My first flavor impression was Chocolate. A big, then bigger, then huge mouthful of chocolate at first… followed by what I imagined was pecan pound cake. (Now I think the cake was not made with wheat flour but potato. I know…that sounds crazy.) The tea wasn’t vanilla, yam, cinnamon or malty tasting like so many other popular black tea’s. This was fruity (but not discernable as to what fruit) and clean. I hunted for some acid or tannin…but couldn’t find any. The smoothness was creamy and rich. The difference between this black tea and others was…well…this was like an expensive satin covered down comforter and the others are wool blankets, rough and kind of thin. Everything in a cup like liquid, shimmering amber gold.I let the tea cool down. It was so good plain. Straight up it was sweet, genteel and smooth with NO acid at all! The finish was creamy and I am in love with it!<strong>I love this tea! I really am amazed! This is the first Black Tea of any kind that I can and would drink straight up without sugar or cream always!</strong> I love the Laoshan Black but I think it’s a tie here. This is so mellow!<strong>Second Steep</strong> Still amazing! I forgot to say that when I stuck my nose way down into the cup I was reminded of the fruity scent of wine inside the barrels at Fortino’s Winery where I worked one Summer but without sourness and just the sweet dry wine. The wine produced in that area of California was like liquid sunshine. Ripe sunkissed berries. That’s the fruit somewhere in the scent. The flavor of this tea has no sourness either, but now I taste that distant berry. I feel the cedar and pepper on the front of my tongue but not at the finish so the smoothness is still good. Chocolate delight. Naked! <strong>Third Steeping</strong> I’m not going into the flavor that much. I has all the same qualities that it had before. Such a strong leaf! What I have found at this point is another dimension. One that I stumbled upon because I had an Artist friend that cooked a fantastic dinner served outdoors in the evening served by candlelight. The end of the meal was followed by fine cigars and an aged, expensive Port. <strong>Here’s the part I want to share. This tea has the essense of fine cigars and port about it. A taste, scent…something.</strong>  There I’ve done it. I can’t explain why. See for yourself. I’m putting it out for you to tell me if I’m right or wrong! Because of this brilliance, I’ve upped the rating! I could not help myself!', 'Sipdown! 817 (finally added in teas from momo… sigh). I thought that I didn’t have any of this left, but apparently I did… and not just the remnants from one package, but two are apparently listed in my tea spreadsheet. Interesting – I’ll have to see if I can find the second one… I swear I finished it, though.Anyhow! This is still pretty darn delicious, though I definitely prefer the heavier blacks in the winter, it seems. Dark, rich chocolatey flavours. Looking forward to another couple infusions.ETA: My previous tasting notes indicate that I did in fact sipdown my other sample already, so 816! Hurrah!', 'Enjoying a delicious cup right now. This tea is very rich almost like drinking dessert. A real treat – loving every sip!', 'Well I just got in from out of town and I have been inundated with tea! Samples from Teavivre and Fong Mong, and my order from Verdant. I didn’t really know where to start. I did order the Golden Fleece from Verdant but I didn’t want to dive into that one just yet. I decided I wanted to go for a black tea, western steep, from Verdant, and I chose this one. As I’ve mentioned before I’ve been getting into Chinese black teas lately, so I was already intrigued by this tea. Then I also read about it’s namesake and I can’t resist a dagger-wielding warrior woman, so that clinched the order.The dry leaves are very nice looking, dark with golden streaks, spindley and curly. I can’t smell the dry leaf too well but what I do get smells nice grainy and malty. I steeped exactly according to the instructions on the website for this tea (western style). It smells heavenly. Dark chocolate, molasses, grains, malt, and there’s almost a spiciness that tingles in your nostrils when you take a deep sniff, like sniffing cayenne pepper.The first part of the sip is sweet, almost honeyed, with chocolate notes that kind of shift from a sweeter chocolate at the beginning to a much darker chocolate toward the end. The flavors that build in the latter part of the sip are rougher, less refined than the first flavors. These are a little bit of wood, a little bit of smoke even that tingles in my mouth. Not smoky even like a keemun is smoky, but more the faintest whisp of smoke or maybe like the woody notes are a little charred. As it cools those flavors toward the end of the sip become stronger, making the whole thing a little prickly in the mouthfeel.I enjoy this tea a lot, but I have a feeling I will enjoy the other black teas I bought from Verdant more. We shall see! It has a rough quality about it that I’ve found in other fine black teas; it doesn’t really keep me from enjoying the tea, but it’s not my favorite character in black teas, at least at this point.', 'Alright, time for a real review for the first time in a while.I brewed this tea with shorter infusions today, and the result was pretty amazing. While the flavor wasn;t as intense as usualy, the depth of the flavor was much greater, exposing fruity flavors that I don’t usually notice till much later infusions. This trend continued till the end, with more subtle flavors like cove and potato really asserting themselves for once. I’m really glad that I decided to experiment today.Note –  Steep times by order of appearance: 12 sec., 12 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 35 seconds, 60 seconds.', 'One of those weeks when life is so messy that tea doesn’t taste.’Nuff said.After crying on and praying with a couple of dear friends and a couple of hours of sun-room/cat/Oreo therapy with my surrogate mom, I’m slightly closer to functional. (When she picked up the phone the other day, I said, “Hello? Is this Rent-A-Mom?”)So I celebrated slight functionality by closing my eyes, picking a bag at, well, semi-random from the tea swap basket, and here we are.This one is so good and fleece-blankety, looks like <strong>Terri Harplady</strong> wrote a song to it in one of her reviews some time back. It’s well deserving of odes and kudoes—-big ol’ blonde leaves; bright and bronzey at the first of the sip, rich and cocoa-y at swallow time.Had to leave the leaves at home, but I’m eagerly anticipating a second stanza this evening. Thanks, Terri!', 'I found some black tea in my numerous unsampled sample pouches from Verdant! I have high hopes for the company that turned me on to black tea!First, the fuzzy little curls of dried leaf were beautiful and cute at the same time. The smell made me swoon. So chocolatey! I never really believed it when people would say a tea was chocolatey, but now I am a believer!My first impression of this brew is a chocolatey dark roasted oolong. There are sweet honeyed notes along with the roasty autumnal flavor I usually get from dark oolongs. Then there’s a subtle taste of dark chocolate. The end of the sip is a bit bitter. It’s not ideal but it’s also not bad. In between sips, as you let the lingering flavors play over your tongue, you get a sense of wood chips, like for a campfire. And there’s the slightly hint of astringency. I’m thinking I probably should have used cooler water, though I think the website recommended boiling. Maybe less time.In any case, this tea is delicious! It’s a cross between a dark roasted oolong and my new love, Loashan Black. Tasty!As it cools, I’m getting more of an oolong taste than a black tea taste. Love that lingering dark chocolate flavor. :)Steep 2! Used cooler water and then forgot about it for about 10 minutes. doh! But the resulting tea is magnificent! Lots of dark chocolate notes and something fruity like blueberry jam. No astringency this time. :)', 'This was my good morning cup. Dark and full flavored. I too can see how it can be oversteeped. I love the 5 minute steep. It was awakening. The empty cup aroma was sublime. Totally unique. The second cup was better than the first. I could be wrong but I am getting a coffee flavor. This tea is delicious and I am thoroughly enjoying it. This tea is one of many black teas I have been sampling lately for my coffee replacement. I must add that this was not purchased as a sample.

When i woke up this morning i knew i needed a couple of old favourites to get me through the day since my next few weeks are going to be a little crazy. Got in last night, and now i’m at an offsite for two days which means the work is piling up! There’s a release over the weekend and then i’m back on a plane for a couple of days, which means more work piling up. Long story short…looks like there will be some overtime for a while! eesh.This is such a wonderful tea to kick off my time back in Toronto. On the upside, i think the team is going bowling tonight which will be awesome! even though all i want to do is go home and sleep haha.', 'Today I have been thinking about which teas I want to axe. We have a number of new flavors I would like to test out. Whether they will work out, I’m not sure but I do have a large number of ideas that I would like to start on. Three of my favorite ideas are an Irish Cream Cheesecake, Espresso Stout Beer Tea and Champagne with Rose Cream. I think those will be hard to pull off but I can’t wait to try. The top contenders to be axed are the Raspberry Truffle, Strawberry Oolong, and the Mint Oolong. Also, I’ve just been thinking about trying out a Pumpkin Milkshake tea and seeing how it compares to our current Pumpkin Crème Brulee.On to the tea at hand. I love love love me some Taiwanese Wild Mountain Black and this harvest is fantastic! Leafhoppers are magical creatures! I truly believe this tea needs to be tried in a gongfu session to be really appreciated as that is how I’m getting the most flavor out of it. I have been doing about 7 steeps with this tea with my gaiwan. Here’s a pic of the wet leaves in my cute little red 50ml gaiwan: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/p/dQPsaGFfKn/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://instagram.com/p/dQPsaGFfKn/</a>. From this session, I’m getting heavier honey notes that linger and evolve into powdered sugar notes. Additionally, there are some bready notes with cinnamon and sweet potato. Occasional plum notes peak through the maltiness. This tea is weighty and produces a lovely complex cup of tea. I just absolutely love it! :)', '<strong>Chinese New Year!!!</strong>Granddaughter Schey and I went to Happy Luckys after Church like we normally do, and hopped up onto the bar stools that we usually occupy.“Hey, what did you bring us today?!” Preston asked.With great excitement, I pulled out my bag of Taiwanese Wild Mountain Black Tea which caught Joe’s eye further down behind the cash register.“Wow, is that it?!” Joe exclaimed. (He and Preston had tasted the previous small sample from Butiki but this was MORE!)“Yep, I brought the whole bag in so Eric, Andi, and Schey could have some of this tea too!”I’ve never seen Preston move so fast! He had a Gaiwan, 6 tasting cups and an aroma set (for me) ready in no time.I invited a young man at the bar (he was drinking tangerine stuffed puer that the shop now carries thanks to advice from Steepster <strong>mrmopar</strong>) to join in the tasting.Preston warmed the Gaiwan, placed the leaves inside…waited, then passed the Gaiwan for everyone to smell the aroma. Delicious waffles…this is what we all think the tea smells like!We each held the first golden-amber pour in our cups up high as Eric made a toast in Chinese 新年快乐 (xīn nián kuài lè) for Happy New Year!All that I heard after that were….GROANS AND SIGHS OF DELIGHT!I’ve seldom seen so many speechless, excited tea people. It was a pleasure bringing a grand tea to my friends.In the past month…I’ve shared 2 tea’s that have been in the top 3 that Eric and Joe have ever tasted…Master Hans Black Tea from Verdant and Butiki’s Taiwanese Wild Mountain Black.One final word: What takes my breath away when I drink this tea is the finish.  Just when I’ve swallowed the tea it lifts me up and I’m floating on the most gentle ribbon of lingering flavor that undulates on and on like small ripples in the water. Eventually, my whole body feels the thrill of the tea. (Hard to explain how good it is)This was a grand way to celebrate Chinese New Year!', 'Oh yum!  I totally disregarded the directions (2tsp) &amp; went with 1Tb + 8oz X 3min. YUM!! I have previously not been that impressed by this tea, but I love the way it looks, &amp; because the leaf is so big, I figured why not treat it like I treat Laoshan black? I mean, really, why not? So I did. Now I’m in love with it, it was so much more rich &amp; delicious, fruity &amp; sweet.  I’ll drink it this way from now on, with a 5 minute resteep as well.', 'Oh my gosh. i read roswell strange’s tasting note on this yesterday and realized it had been ages since I’ve had this. For some crazy reason unbeknownst to me, I somehow thought I was getting over this tea, but this morning’s cup was a resounding reminder that this indeed was not the case. I nearly gasped out loud after I took my first sip, and quickly pushed the cup toward Mr. Keychange to have a sip. “My gosh!” he exclaimed, “What flavour is this one?” “Aha!” I exclaimed on Stacey’s behalf, “it isn’t flavoured! this is just the great Taiwanese wild mountain black! doesn’t it taste like waffles?” “Wow, so the tea just tastes like that?”Which is exactly my own awe at this tea. I don’t know if there’s any left to order, but I sure hope there is, as I’ll be topping up very soon. Mmm. Creamy, honeyed waffle deliciousness, with the signature taste of black tea aftertaste. I seriously don’t know what was stopping me from having this more often!', 'I have been thinking about Butiki custom blend contest entries lately, which has led to thinking about Butiki teas in general. I haven’t had this one in a bit and I wanted to come back to it. This time I brewed it at four minutes, as suggested.Mmm, yes I would say this one really shines at four minutes. Honey, apricots, and a thick, rich texture. This time I can see where waffles are coming from, as well as the slightly powdery sweetness of confectioners sugar. Although I typically am not quite as fond of fruity blacks, the richness of this one totally balances it out and gives it that extra oomph. Quite a delicious tea, and worth of the hype.', '1 tbsp in 12ozEvery time I don’t have this tea for a couple of weeks and then have it again, it’s an experience. Seriously, there can be no better taste on earth than this. It’s crazy how much I love it. Nothing else compares. Other Taiwanese blacks are kind of <em>similar</em> but this one is unique and just amazing.Just a couple of tablespoons left to hold me until it’s available again. Eek.', 'I want one of those “I Love Leafhoppers” magnets. They’re cute and our fridge could use some decoration.Small glass gongfu, short, variable steep style.Every time I drink this tea I feel like I’m spoiling myself. I don’t drink this often, not because I’m hoarding it- “things” just have to click together first. That’s fine though, as it will last longer that way!', 'I’ve been reading about this tea since I started on steepster back in March and it’s been pretty much sold out since then. So needless to say, I’ve been super excited to finally try it.It doesn’t dissapoint. It’s sweet and full of spices. I can’t for the life of me figure out how an unflavored tea leaf can taste so strongly of cinnamon, nutmeg, and sweet potato pie. It’s kind of a shock to the system. The first sip caught me totally off guard. As I continued to drink it my head just started spinning trying to figure out all the flavors in that little cup. So I stopped thinking and just enjoyed it. It’s not a heavy dark cup at all, which tends to be my preference, but the flavors are so crazy delicious that I can imagine this being a great afternoon tea.I’ve had a few cups since. I’ll definitely need to stock up before it runs out again (warn me when that’s close <strong>Stacy</strong>!)', 'Sipdown (196/200)!Ok, that’s not the actual total because my cupboard isn’t updated yet, but it is the total I had at the time of making this yesterday…I am heartbroken to see this one go. I instantly fell in love with it and I want it in my life forever and ever. If we don’t meet again I will be one miserable, heartbroken tea drinker. However, I went to the dentist’s yesterday to get some work done (and yay, because I haven’t been in pain since!) and I knew I wanted something black and delicious and just perfect to take with me on the bus ride there and home and nothing else seemed like it would do.So, I steeped up a timolino of this and added in a splash of milk and very happily sipped at my liquid waffles and baked bread and caramel deliciousness on the way there and back until every last drop was gone. And then when I was home I resteeped and repeated the process. I made damn good use of my splendid waffle tea, and when finally the leaves had given all they could I sat down, drooling a little a lot because I couldn’t feel half my face at all, and made a really mopey, pouty face for the next few hours.Well, I tried to make a pouty face. I had no feeling in half my face and couldn’t get that half to cooperate and move for the pouty face.

I do end up a little confused since the ingredients list is only “black tea”. Based on the flavors within I am assuming it is an unflavored blend of various black teas, but I would love to know what they were. It’s honestly the type of thing that keeps me from ordering such a tea because I don’t really know what’s in it. “Black tea” is not a thing; every black tea is a varietal, and while it may not mean much to some of your customers, it means quite a lot to others. Even just saying “China” versus “India” or “Sri Lanka” can communicate a lot more information (for instance, I generally stay away from Indian teas).Anyway, with that rant over, this is a lovely tea. Very chocolatey… it reminds me a bit of a Fengqing black dragon pearl, though not pearled, obviously. There are bright fruity notes and I do think they come across as a tart, fresh cherry. There is a bit of hay and the robustness of malt. Very smooth, very tasty. Thanks for the sample, MissB!', 'How have I avoided this one so long?! This is a beautiful, multifaceted, inspiring tea. I’m looking forward to the re-steeps!The first sips were most definitely dark chocolate, then a bit of malt and sugarcane. Sugarcane? That’s a first for me. Like of all of Brenden’s creations, I also get something very campfire/outdoorsy in this, almost oaky, or smokey, or both. Fruit? Something light and sweet in there too in the background, although it’s a new flavor for me so I struggle to place it. All in all, this is exquisite.

It has nothing whatever to do with money or power. It’s something in the heart.I’m happy to have found my ‘Home’ for now. I always say ‘for now’ in case God has other plans for me. My heart happiness is portable.Brenden has decided to create his tea’s without artifical flavors or the low quality tea’s found in far too many blends. Yeah! I’m a great fan of all the Tea Companies that don’t use artificial ingredients and who don’t compromise on quality!North Winds: The wonderful Fujian Black Tea (which I bought from Whispering Pines already because it’s so Cocoa-luscious) base is cocoa and milky, not a dark chocolate. I didn’t taste cherry, mentioned in the description Brenden wrote,..but instead tasted sweet tea cookie (like animal cracker).  The tea was creamy, buttery with malted caramel, chocolate filled pastry.Goodness! How on earth do you discribe how good this tea tasted?Please try it with cream and sweeten. This type of tea is enhanced a great deal by both (brings the cocoa alive and a richness to dessert level).I’d suggest having North Winds over the holidays with shortbread or sugar cookies with people who love you .', 'Oh So I lied I will review my Kombucha, it IS after all a Whispering Pines Tea :) So put some Chaga and Reishi mushroom tea in my North Winds Kombucha this morning and it was pretty good.  I can already taste the malty, cocoa sweetness of the North Winds in my kombucha and the brew itself has the perfect tangy sweet slightly sour bite that i’ve tweaked to my personal taste which is i’d have to say is just slightly a bit more sour than a kombucha that you’d buy at the store, very good imo :)  Now with the added mushroom juice it’s about as tangy as a store bought kombucha with awesome woody, earthy,mushroomy notes that really tastes like something from the forest, something magical even, I love it!! It makes me feel good and happy too.', 'After months upon months of sampling and finally choosing the right tea for the job, our newly-redesigned house black tea, North Winds, is now available! Read about the inspiration and new flavor profile below!Michigan is full of wondrous little towns known for the things they have perfected and small spots of nature that will take your breath away. This tea is inspired by the entire northern area of Michigan, from Traverse City to the Les Cheneaux Islands.Traverse City is in the northern lower peninsula of the state. They are widely known for their amazing cherries, which are sold alongside other fruits from roadside stands during the summer months. You can get anything cherry here, and it will spoil you for cherries forever. I’ll never be able to eat cherries elsewhere! =)Heading northward from the cherry capitol of the world and over the longest suspension bridge in the northern hemisphere brings you to Mackinac Island. This island is full of little shops, cafes, and bakeries, and they are very well known for their fudge. Any flavor of fudge you can imagine can be found on this island, but you can never go wrong with a piece of dark chocolate fudge as Autumn is closing in!As the north winds bring you higher and the first snow begins to fall, the Les Cheneaux Islands and surrounding area of the upper peninsula will send chills down your spine. The wind picks up, the lake begins to freeze, and a snowstorm will keep you indoors with a hefty cup of black tea as company. Looking outside at the winter wonderland, you can’t help but notice that you are in the most beautiful place in the world.Our house black tea for good reason — North Winds is the essence of northern Michigan. Sweet fruity notes of apricot and white grape bring you to Traverse City while heavy dark chocolate notes allow you to have that Mackinac Island fudge desert without having to take the ferry. Notes of toasted rye with cherry preserves show up mid-sip with a beautiful malt and wildflower honey finish. These smooth, decadent notes combine into a medium-bodied tea with a bold and rustic feel that makes for a perfect breakfast tea — but you’ll want to drink this all day long!North Winds is blended seasonally to achieve the most balanced flavor profile. The current offering is a blend of Spring and Autumn 2014 material from Fujian and Yunnan provinces of China.Available here: <a href=\"http://whisperingpinestea.com/north-winds.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://whisperingpinestea.com/north-winds.html</a>', 'I have had this in my cupboard for a while so presumably what I have is the old version. Still delicious. I drank this a week ago but I need to catch up on my tasting notes.', 'It was cool enough this morning to enjoy a cup of tea and I picked this one. I don’t have too much left!! Yikes. This remains one of my favorite black teas. Strong enough for breakfast, but not bitter or overpowering. I think this one will stay in my cupboard all the time.It has been almost 6 weeks since surgery and I’m still not breathing well or smelling anything . Of course I’m disappointed but I’m not any worse off than I was before surgery. Except for my finances. Surgery was about $9,000, of which I am responsible for $1722. Too bad you don’t get a refund if it doesn’t work. I see the ENT on June 1 for my final post-op appointment. I’m harboring a teensy sliver of hope that I will be able to breathe and smell, but it’s not very likely. I need to remind myself that there are worse things than not being able to smell the cat’s litterbox.', 'Another superbly wonderful tea from Whispering Pines. I’m adding my review here as I believe I have the old version. It seems sad to say that, because I’m enjoying this cup immensely. Still, seasons change and all that. Clearly I’ll have to try the new version to compare!Anyway, the tea. I used 1.5 tsp of leaf, and gave it three minutes in boiling water. I added a splash of milk (just the tiniest one, though!) The scent of the dry leaf is wonderfully chocolatey, like opening a tin of cocoa powder and taking a sniff.To taste, this is probably the nicest quality black blend I’ve tried in a good long while. The initial flavour is chocolate; quite dark and rich, but with a deliciously smooth, creamy edge. A mild fruitiness emerges in the mid-sip, initially cherry (chocolate covered cherry, anyone?), but ultimately turning more towards apricot. It’s light, fruity, and juicy-tasting, and the perfect counterpoint to the chocolate/cream richness of the initial sip. The end of the sip is heavily malty, with all the sweetness that implies, with a touch of honey. It’s also gloriously smooth. The chocolate flavour lingers in the aftertaste, making this an almost decadent treat. I consider my morning thoroughly brightened! This one is definitely going on my shopping list!', 'This is a very tasty tea. Yesterday I had the best of news from my lawyer in my worker’s comp case.

I guess the fact that I still have some of this is testament to my addictive nature &amp; tendency to hoard tea, right? You don’t really want to know how much of this tea I bought when it was available, but I’m probably the reason it went out of stock, LOL.  I’m down to the dregs of it now.  I love it so much!

I really got the dark chocolate many are talking about. The aftertaste really tricks you and makes you think you just had a couple squares of dark chocolate. Sneaky!

I put the leaves in the fridge overnight, excited to take the second round to my three-hour morning class in my Timolino, hoping it would keep things interesting. I woke up with a so-called stomach flu, so not sure if it was the nausea and what not that turned me off, or the Timolino made this taste weird, but that mineral note was amped up to the roof. I only tasted a twangy, almost metallic note that made me hate life there for a second.Now that I’m basically over the illness, I’m giving this a second chance. Again, the first steep was the same, super dark chocolate and malty.The second steep now is much better. Yes, the mineral undertone is there but it is very subdued, but wheeee, the chocolate is still there, and the maltiness, and something else? Coffee! It’s coffee and cake in a cup.\\nI like.

Still, as long as we’re getting into semantics, this isn’t smoky – it’s just char. So I don’t outright dislike it. As it cools I taste a starchy bread undertone. maybe a hint of burnt sugar/caramel. Come to think of it, I don’t think anything burnt was actually in the taste – just the smell. I can live with this.steep two: 20 seconds, mostly because my hands just aren’t fast enough to get everything poured any faster. This steep smells more like burnt sweet potato fries. Taste is more chocolaty – dark cocoa powder.steep three: 35-ish seconds. Leaves smell ashy/charred but the liquor smells caramel sweet. This makes me happy. Taste is sweet, smooth vanilla caramel.steep four: 1 minute. I’m amazed at how those leaves smell so different than the steeped liquor or taste. Now the caramel has transitioned into a honey note. But its got kind of a roasty flavor in the background, so…honey on toast? Its interesting how the liquor seems to get sweeter with each steeping, which I am loving!steep five: 3 minutes. Multiple steepings are always so hard for me because I just don’t drink alot of any drink at once, unless I’m eating dinner. The fact that I’ve gone 5 rounds (so, 30 oz) with this in an hour is actually pretty darn impressive. Flavor has changed to what I thought the initial smell of the leaf reminded me of – chocolate covered raisins. It’s more of the unsweetened cocoa powder than milk chocolate though. Still a very nectary mouthfeel, even though I’m five steeps in. I’m not going to be able to hold any more tea tonight though, so I’ll save the leaves in my gaiwan for tomorrow.I can’t believe how long its been since I’ve had this – long enough that its not in stock anymore.

Heh. I also haven’t been drinking quite as much tea, although the flurry of notes I’m about to post will make you believe differently (they’re from the past week or more, though, so not many per day).So this tea. I swear, everytime I brew it up, I’ve forgotten how delicious it is. It’s <em>so</em> burny and toasty and chocolatey… mostly burny (but not in an ashy sense), and I quite like it. Stands up well in a travel mug, and for multiple western-style infusions. I think I have maybe 3 packets of it left (I use a whole 5? 7?g packet when I brew it up).', 'I feel sad that there are people out there who will never try this tea. I realised that this marks 4k tasting notes since i started hanging out on steepster. 2 years, 400 pages of tasting notes, 1738 teas tried (give or take a few) and i only just now feel like i’m starting to understand what i love about certain teas. When i realised this was to be 4k…i went into the special box. the box of teas that i hoard because they will either be gone for too long or because i feel like it :P There are 3 teas in there….this is one of them.This was graciously passed to me by <strong>omgsrsly</strong> when i bemoaned the fact that i only had one single packet of this tea left. I still only have one package of this left – the other one from my tea sister terri. I really hope that someday verdant is able to get this tea back, or some variation on the theme from the family experimenting more.', 'Sipdown! (That wasn’t in my cupboard lol) I got another packet of this from my friend who wasn’t a fan. I’ve been in a bit of a weird tea rut lately, I am enjoying the teas I’ve been drinking, but none have been <strong>the one</strong> to satisfy my craving. I think I found it, though, in this one. <strong>This turned out spectacularly tonight</strong>.I followed <strong>TerriHarpLady</strong> ‘s parameters for western brewing a bit, since I’m too lazy for a gaiwan tonight. I used the whole little red packet in my big 16 oz DavidsTea mug, but I couldn’t steep it for 3 minutes, just did 2 :P (chickened out, and it’s pretty late here, but man I needed this tea). The resulting tea..wow. I inhaled the aroma the whole time it cooled, chocolate cake and caramel, but a different tea than LB.And the taste? Wow. So good. Dark chocolate, caramel, I can picture it now. It is slightly reminiscent of my favorite dessert of all time, chocolate steam pudding (essentially dark cocoa cake smothered in caramel sauce made of brown sugar and cream). It isn’t nearly as sweet as that dessert, but I definitely taste notes of it in here. And it is soooo good.Hitting the spot. Just what I needed. Perfect. I am sad because this is currently not in stock, if I had tried it like this, I probably would have picked up an oz. This might bump LB out of the top chocolatey black that I’ve tried now! Ooh, and there’s this lovely slightly burnt note in the start of the sip, making it feel like the cake has been slightly burnt in the oven, just enough to have a crisp layer on top…mmmm.Ok, I will stop rambling, but this is seriously good! Have no fear in trying this tea with a lot of leaf! So good! See previous notes for this one done gaiwan style :) and upping rating a bit due to the pure awesomeness of this cup.', 'Full Review on Sororiteasisters.com on the 31st but here are my snippits:Anxi Fo Shou Black Tea from Verdant Tea is scrumptious! When I was opening the bag I could smell the chocolate notes just jumping out at me. I was surprised to find yet another sealed bag inside the first bag which told me this tea was very heavy with flavor notes considering how strong and wonderful the aroma was through not one but two sealed bags!If you notice the flavor notes listed by Verdant Tea “NOTES: chocolate, scotch, caramel, walnut, coconut, jasmine” I want to note that every single note is easily detectable.The distinct note in the beginning is the chocolate note but caramel peeks through nicely. As the tea cools down some there is a note of a single malt scotch and a light lilting note of coconut! The walnut note lays nicely all over the tongue giving a slight drying sensation like walnut typically does, yet this tea is anything but drying! It is refreshing and juicy!Yes friends, this is a true winner and if I had any tea funds I would jump right on the Verdant Website and order more RIGHT NOW. I am so excited to have had a chance to get some of this tea and will be cherishing what remains of my stash. Hopefully soon I can order more if there is any left to order!', 'I did NOT sleep enough last night. Day from hell yesterday, nearly everything that go wrong, went wrong.

I hope/assume it’s this tea).Wow. What a smooth, full-bodied, flavorful cup this is. I brewed it for the full five minutes suggested, all the while worrying it might turn bitter, but such was not the case. No bitterness whatsoever. I did not get the tobacco notes — which is fine with me, because I’m not fond of tobacco or anything smoky — but I did sense honey, dark chocolate, caramel and a hint of fresh-baked bread. The mouth-feel is sort of thick and heavy, in a pleasant way, but there is no aftertaste. The liquor is golden-reddish-brown.This is robust without being rough. Elegant, even. But not delicate.

It’s a dark copper color.The tea is smooth and easy to drink. Delicious but without the same depth and malty quality of some of the other ATR Yunnans. It’s not that there’s no depth or maltiness, just that it’s a different version, like the difference between milk chocolate and dark chocolate.

Smell it out of the bag and the first thing I smell is <strong>CREAM!</strong> Super super sweet <strong>CREAM!</strong>I have more of this tea than I originally intended. I was just going to buy a little bit, but then shipping was $5, and I didn’t know/see that other samples would be included, so I bought a bigger bag. I read several reviews on Steepster to find the highest rated EGC, and this one swept them away.I’m trying to decide how I feel about this tea. The bergamot is pretty punchy, and the vanilla is REALLY REALLY SWEET, and the two flavors put together are kind of like that photo of Elvis Presley and Richard Nixon shaking hands:<a href=\"http://images.usatoday.com/life/_photos/2007/01/08/nixon.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://images.usatoday.com/life/_photos/2007/01/08/nixon.jpg</a>OK so drinking tea is a little more fun than they look like they’re having. But like, the two flavors both have such distinctive reputations and personalities, but put together with both flavors turned up to the max, it’s a bit of an awkward combo, at least to my tastebuds. I think it’s the vanilla’s fault; it’s a little too sweet for me. Which was what I was afraid would happen. Maybe it’s something I’ll get used to, but I think I prefer Mahamosa’s version.I feel like I’m the Simon Cowell of Steepster Idol! I keep having cynical things to say about teas everyone else raves about!That said, however, I have a side question. Pumpkin flavored teas. I want access to pumpkin flavored beverages without always having to go to Starbucks for their pumpkin spice latte, which I find delicious. What are your recommendations? I’ve heard numerous good things about Butiki’s Pumpkin Creme Brulee.', '<strong>Tea #38 from HHTTB2</strong>I can’t get over how sweet and creamy this is! This is amazing!The leaves just smell sweet and vanilla-y. I want to fall into this cup and just chill for a couple hours.All the flavors are in perfect balance. The bergamot isn’t overdone, but definitely has a refreshing punchiness. And the vanilla cream component is smooth and not at all artificial tasting. There’s actually a lingering creaminess after each sip!When I run out of my current EGC you can bet this will be the replacement.', 'I have read so many great reviews for Earl Grey Cream teas from various companies that it made me curious. Why do people love it so much? When <strong>Zen Tea</strong> offered to let me pick three teas to sample, it was easy to decide to put this one on the list!And WHOA! I tore open the pouch and the creamy vanilla swirled up and kissed me smack on the lips. I am pretty sure there is a puddle of drool where I was standing because it smelled so good.I don’t know quite what I was expecting, but I can tell you what I got. This IS what it says it is – Earl Grey tea with cream. But not just cream…it is rich, homemade fresh-whipped vanilla-imbued cream that has been sitting on top of a hot and decadent dessert.Yummy! No wonder people love it! Thank you, Zen Tea, for allowing me to finally experience this tea! If you like Earl Grey and you like vanilla, you really should try this.', 'Sad sip down! I actually finished this last night, as a pseudo London Fog again and was it ever scrumptious. That means I ripped through my 1 oz. bag in one week. It’s safe to say that I should pick up more.If you’re looking for a smooth, creamy, vanilla-packed EGC and you haven’t tried this one yet, I urge you to do so.', 'It’s a sad day for tea when my favorite EGC is no longer the same. I received some of the new batch recently. This is an entirely different EGC in my opinion. (Zen is telling me the supplier changed it on them.) Less of that amazing cream (if any) and definitely a different bergamot – and not one I particularly want to drink. It’s probably okay for an EG but not the magic it was before! Sad stuff.', 'Yay! Another sample. I think this one is from <strong>Veronica</strong>, but I might be wrong. (ACK!) I need to be better at labelling my samples and swaps when they come in.I added a little honey to this because my throat is still sore. Ugh. And I have a horribly long day at work as well. I worked late yesterday, then slept in by accident and rolled out of bed and have been working at home drinking tea and eating breakfast. I have to head in soon, though. I’d rather go grocery shopping and set up some stuff in the crock pot and do the paperwork from home…This Earl Grey Cream is actually pretty good! Normally I’d add loads of milk and honey to an EG, but with this no sugar thing, I’m appreciating the flavours of the teas more. With just a tiny bit of honey, this is moderately bergamot-y and fairly creamy. Not as creamy as cream, but I can tell it’s there.I don’t know that I’d stock it, as I prefer Paris for an alternate EG, but this is nice.', 'Oh dear, it looks like I might be ordering from Zen Tea after all…now I know why everybody’s abuzz about this! It has a very light note of coconut and a sweetness that is not in the other EGCs. What more can I say? I like this EGC a lot!Thank you for sharing this tea with me, sweet <strong>Veronica</strong> ! (pretends to be visiting for afternoon tea) :D', 'Um, yeah, wow. This is seriously good EGC. Majorly creamy, smooth and definitely bergamotty. If I were to have to pick one EGC to have in the cupboard, this would be it. I wish Zen had other teas I liked or wanted to try.

But subsequent infusions adopts a heavier wood-like taste with malt and dried apricot background. I haven’t seen how it tasted following the end-stage infusions, so can’t give much of a comment on that.I did prepare this western style once quite a while ago, and I do have to say that western style is the recommended way to approach this tea. It had a very complex yet harmonic taste, consisting of fruits (with apricot as main), honey, general sweetness, light wood, chocolate, and a maltyness around it. I believe gongfu style doesn’t allow the blend of leaves to steep sufficiently enough to have the combined flavour from all of them, but instead prefers the faster steeping leaves over the others.Not a bad tea, but not recommended if you prefer tea gongfu style.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Apricot, Baked Bread, Dried Fruit, Malt, Wood\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Since I haven’t reviewed too many blends this month, I motivated myself to finally break out the last of this one. A blend of three Chinese black teas, The Jabberwocky has become one of Whispering Pines’ signature teas. It is a highly regarded blend with a wide following here on Steepster. I found it to more or less live up to the hype.I prepared this tea gongfu style. After a quick rinse, I steeped 6 grams of loose tea leaves in 4 ounces of 205 F water for 5 seconds. I followed this infusion up with 14 additional infusions. Steep times for these infusions were as follows: 8 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, 1 minute, 1 minute 15 seconds, 1 minute 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes.Prior to the rinse, the dry tea leaves produced interesting aromas of chocolate, honey, wood, and stone fruits. After the rinse, the honey and stone fruit aromas intensified and were joined by emerging scents of orange, toast, and malt. The first infusion produced a bouquet that saw malt and toast aromas continue to develop. In the mouth, a pleasant and robust mix of wood, brown toast, fresh bread, cream, malt, honey, orange, caramel, sweet potato, and indistinct stone fruit notes washed across the palate. Subsequent infusions produced a bouquet that was maltier, fruitier, and more honeyed. Aromas and flavors of raisin, apricot, nectarine, and peach emerged. I also began to catch hints of camphor, eucalyptus, and minerals on the finish. Later infusions were dominated by wood, malt, chocolate, brown toast, and citrus notes coupled with touches of caramel and stone fruits. The camphor, mineral, and eucalyptus notes on the finish were also amplified, producing a unique and soothing cooling effect.This is probably one of the most complex and refined black tea blends I have ever tried. It was not quite what I was expecting (I had heard that this blend was incredibly strong, so I was expecting it to absolutely knock me for a loop), but I was far from disappointed. Though it mellowed a little quicker than I would have liked, it still had considerable staying power and a gorgeous layering of aromas and flavors.

A bit more complexity is revealed as the tea cools, and a second steep yields nearly identical flavors as the first, but things quickly fade by the third infusion.I’m curious about the origin of this tea – since it is from Guangxi I don’t think it is related to Biluochun (the famous Green Snail Spring tea sometimes called Green Spiral); I see Hojo sells a “Golden Bud” tea made from Ling-Yun Bai-hao, also from Guangxi, but that appears to be processed more like what Tao of Tea sells as “Emperor’s Gold” (from Yunnan).

It has beautiful leaves, great liquor clarity, exhibits a good range of flavors, has a decent balance of body and liveliness, and produces a very distinct flavor set some people may adore… I’m just not a huge fan of some of the characteristics it possesses. I can’t justify rating it as a simply “okay” tea or as though it is “lesser-than” some of the teas I love, though, because of the steadfast, clear flavors and aromatics it produces.What I dislike is a fairly heady, almost-overripe dried fruit aroma/nose that is reminiscent of what I get from certain Sonoma Valley Chardonnays. Also, there is a flavor that reminds me of the smell of old glue that has failed over the years to hold the spine of an old book – to me it tastes a bit like the air of my local public library. Tweak these characteristics a bit more to the grapey side, and you’d wind up with a nice, somewhat woody Darjeeling-like character. Tweak ‘em a bit to the malt side and you’d have a fruited and elegant Assam characteristic. Where it stands, I’m not particularly fond of it… I’m sure there are folks who’d fall head over heels about it, though. A rinse lowers these tones a bit out of the almost-cloying range into base characteristics of the nose.Aside from these bits, it’s a very pleasant, approachable light Chinese red. Medium body feels like it ought to be a bit heavier to accommodate the flavors that are expressed, but this is a trait I’m used to in Fujian reds as a whole. Liquor color is a stunning deep red orange like the color of recently made bricks. Plucking standard is pretty darn uniform and comprised exclusively of young, intact leaves and buds (plus a small twig here and there). Torn leaves are still young and the sizing conforms to the length of the rest of the material.Unlike the dried apricot fruit notes of many other Golden Monkey reds (and inherent in the dry fragrance of four others I tasted along side this in a cupping earlier) this one exhibits more of a white nectarine skin fragrance alongside the wood and cocoa. Wet aroma brings out the aforementioned chardonnay note with more of a wet cocoa powder characteristic. The overarching characteristic of the liquor aroma is malt.Cocoa jumps forward in the flavor, though it isn’t an exceptionally chocolatey tea. Interestingly, I get a good amount of rose and rosebush foliage notes in the flavor and aftertaste/afteraroma. Very ripe white peach hangs around as a dull perfume both in the cup and transferred from the mouth up into the sinuses for a double-dose (fortunately, it isn’t intense or pervasive). Drinking from a gaiwan using a rinse and 4g per 115ml in 90 degrees C water, mostly malty and woody flavors run through the bulk of the flavor. In cupping with 2.5g per 125ml water just off a boil (5 min steep) I get more cinnamon raisin bread as a base and a primary high note of ripe stonefruit peel (again, white peach/nectarine or maybe even pluot skin). Leaves a crisp impression and very faint sweetness to the breath hanging deep in the throat like that of chewing a bit of dry oak wood (little less grassy than a typical toothpick or stir stick). Nose is mostly floral with those light cocoa notes but there is a base of wet clay and malt serving as a backbone and rounding it out.Overall, very approachable and smooth. Not a ton setting it apart as a red tea, but a distinct step in flavor clarity above many of this group of teas. When cupped alongside four Golden Monkeys sold by Plymouth Tea Company, this one stands up with the best tactile balance and has the easiest identifiable character to it. Not sure whether it’s the case or not, but it tastes “fresher” despite being the same harvest or older. I suspect the fairly strict plucking standard of very young first flush leaves and relative lacking of broken material is largely responsible for this effect.Personally, I like the Golden Monkey I bought from Silk Road a few years ago much better, and probably wouldn’t buy this for my personal satisfaction; however, I highly recommend fans of easy-drinking red teas to give this one a try and have no qualms giving this as a gift.Will be pitting this against Red Blossom’s two Golden Monkeys soon…', 'I received a sampler from Silk Road yesterday and let me tell you that this earthy varietal is something special. I did three infusions (gaiwan-style baby!) and the third was still just as lovely as the first. Interestingly, it tasted sweeter after the third infusion. If you fancy yourself to have a sharp tea palate, this one should prove to be quite the challenge as it has several levels of taste experience. I’m going to buy a few pounds of this!', 'This is by far one of the best black teas I’ve ever tasted.', 'I really enjoyed this tea. It has a nice malt flavor, which forgave my neglect as I let it steep too long. I will be buying more', 'Assuming that this Golden Monkey is the higher grade variety that Silk Road offers, this tea is really quite a find. Most gold-bud black teas will have about 20% gold buds; however, this tea is closer to 50/50 on the tea leaves to tea buds front.  I was initially brewing this at 200-boiling, however after accidentally brewing it at 180F I realized the true potential of this tea. The lower brewing temperature allows for more of the soft maltiness of the roasted teabuds to shine through, while not allowing the black tea leaves to oversteep and exude their bittering astringency. As a teadrinker who tends to stray away from black teas, this Golden Monkey is one of a kind in the class of gold-bud teas.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Chocolate, Cocoa, Malt\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Chewing on a couple dry strands reveals a dusty (sawdust like) crunchy, mellow taste with the slightest hint of bitterness. The cup that follows is similar in taste. This batch had many more golden buds and was much more dusty than my order last March. I’m guessing it was taken from the bottom of the bin while my previous order was probably from the top. I’ve been out of this tea for a couple weeks and the first sip is like sitting down with an old friend. The cup is mellow and smooth with a nice chocolaty flavor that resides on the pallet for some time afterwards. Brewing the cup for 4 min 15 seconds is my preferred length of time. It results in a chocolaty and malty cup with a texture that coats the tongue. I find 4 minutes results in a slight numbing of the tongue (not unlike a sip of coca tea) which steadily fades. That numbness as well as a hint of dried apples is overpowered by a chocolaty, almost coffee like flavor when steeped for 4 min 30 seconds or more. The longer steep also results in a hint of bitterness that isn’t present when steeped for a shorter amount of time. The tea feels strong in both caffeine and theanine. This along with Silk’s White Peony I prefer to keep continuously stocked. These two along with Mi Xian Black and Caramel Assam by Butiki are by far the best teas to dance with these taste receptors. My first order of a few pounds came with a free gaiwan and a few tasting cups. This act of kindness has resulted in me becoming a life-long customer. With a tea like GM (Jin Hou) it makes that easy. By far, one of the best teas from Silk I’ve had the pleasure of tasting and one I could easily drink for life.'], 'Polarity': [0.25, 0.13833333333333334, 0.17933333333333334, 0.1970833333333333, 0.14639502164502163, 0.14682539682539683, 0.31111111111111117, 0.3875, 0.15294117647058822, 0.19412698412698415], 'Mouthfeel': '', 'Flavor Profile': {'Spicy': 0.625, 'Char': 0.0, 'Sweet': 0.25, 'Nutty': 0.0625, 'Floral': 0.0, 'Herbs': 0.0, 'Vegetables': 0.0, 'Grass': 0.0, 'Wood': 0.0, 'Earth': 0.0, 'Mineral': 0.0, 'Marine': 0.0, 'Berry': 0.0, 'Citrus': 0.0, 'Tree Fruit': 0.0625, 'Tropical': 0.0}}\n",

New harvest? Smells funny. I understand now why some folks have recently been off put by the smell. It’s very earthy to me and honestly when it got wet it was sort of wet mud. My other half said it smelled like bread. My old delicious wonderful harvest? It smells like cocoa…delicious cocoa.2. Western brew since quite frankly that’s my favourite way to brew LB. I must have sat and stared at my two cups, smelling the wet leaves, smelling the cups, looking at the liquor…just waiting…3. First sips…oh man, it’s been a while since i’ve tasted you my old friend. The new harvest? It’s still chocolately and malty but there’s a bitterness in the back that makes it a little less smooth than my spring harvest. The old harvest is a little sweeter too, though it’s a dark malty chocolate so it’s not “sweet” exactly.Final Verdict? While the taste of the two isn’t that far off – at least not enough that a black tea lover like myself would strongly object – the SMELL from the wet leaf is really quite off putting. It’s enough to make me hesitant about drinking it until the liquid is actually in my mouth. Will i repurchase this harvest? Maybe.

Not only was it pretty darn delicious cold (very dark chocolate), I added sweetener (yep, maple syrup is the current sweetener of choice for cold beverages as it’s the only liquid sweetener I currently have), and I sucked back the cup in no time. It didn’t necessarily <strong>need</strong> it, I just wanted it to be sweet. The maple syrup really brought out the dark chocolate notes, so it was very satisfying.

I’ve been mixing elderberries, ginger, chysanthemum, fennel, jasmine, burduck root, cassia to pu’er on occasion, whipping up tasty brews to satisfy my creative nature (this seems to work best with milder pu-er).A big pinch of Laoshan Black added into Ginger Sage Winter Spa Blend is delicious (one of my favorites)!  My cocoa hull pu’er (called choco pu) with a pinch of Laoshan Black is amazingly rich.This morning, I made a big pot of tea which I drank Naked. Laoshan Black and nothing added to it!.  It was an especially sensual tea drinking experience! (The guttural tea noises you can make when nobody is around!) A-hum! You know what I’m talking about…come on, don’t pretend you don’t!How could I have forgotten the cocoa goodness? Had it been so long since my last cup of Laoshan Black tea?The new batch has to be even richer and creamier than before.  <strong>DD (David Duckler) is up to something, I know he is!</strong> That grainy texture mentioned by many people in earlier reviews was missing. Maybe it was just Me? (Hope not!) But this was richer and creamier than I remembered.No, this isn’t a hyped review of a tea. This isn’t an undeserved review.<strong>It is as good as hundreds of people say. Even…Better!</strong>', 'I am spoiling myself today with awesome teas :D and holy hannah, is this ever AMAZING tonight. I probably shouldn’t be having caffeine this late, but meh, I’ll be up studying anyways. This is like <strong>so good</strong> today. I did it Western for 3 minutes, and I have this caramel soaked brownie in my cup. This is the most caramelly I have ever gotten Laoshan Black to taste. No idea what I did differently lol, but it is awesome! I actually feel like I’m eating dessert. Rich and excellent. Maybe another steep or two tonight as well. See previous notes!', 'I am currently on a slightly earlier schedule for my wakeup and such than I was before I left for the field, partly due to the jetlag and partly due to just having an earlier sleep schedule while I was in the field. It’s kind of nice having a big chunk of time before lunch to do stuff, and it also means I have time for two mugs of tea instead of one. Score! Originally I was going to do what amounts to a little less than 1Tbsp for my 12oz cup, which is becoming kind of a standard for fluffy black teas for me, but then I reread my old tasting note for this that said I had used 1Tbsp per 8oz in my first cup and it seems to have worked out, so I added another perfect teaspoon to the mug (total 1.5Tbsp) and went ahead from there.Oh my goodness this smells delicious. Like lovely bakey chocolate, like chocolate cookies or chocolate chips after they’ve been baked in chocolate chip cookies. Tastes delicious as well, and the liquor is so thick and rich on the tongue. Chocolatey, grainy, nutty. It’s less caramelly and honeyed than some of my other favorite blacks, but it also has some almost fruity note the others lack. I can’t even really place it, but it’s a great combo, and now that I started tasting it, it’s coming out more and more. Almost like black currant? Yum.I am sad that the Bergamot Rose Laoshan Black is currently out of stock, but I am heartened that it will be back within 2 weeks, because I have <strong>got</strong> to try that blend. It will be one of the only teas I allow myself to order this fall, and I can’t wait!', 'I am actually upping my rating on this today. I was having a wussy cup of tea and thought to myself, where is that Laoshan black stuff? I must have some now!Good morning world!Well if this tea does not wake you up and make an impression upon you, you are probably dead.Very chocolate-y, malty and dark. Pretty delicious! I am loving this with some soymilk this morning. Definitely a great morning cup of tea if you want something a bit stronger. Thankfully I do not detect any bitterness here which is a great thing for moi. If you miss the taste of coffee you will most likely adore this.', 'I just broke into my newest package of laoshan black. Is it possible that this is even chocolatier and honey sweet? Maybe it’s just amazing because I haven’t had it in a few weeks and I made extra strong this morning. Morning bliss!', 'Sipdown :(… because I’m going to pick up my Verdant package and I need more room on my special Verdant wall. Also – they taste so much better when they’re fresh, so I need to just suck it up and drink the teas while they are fresh and delicious! So there. :)Yummy today! I’m starting my job tomorrow, the shift is only 8:30-1 and you have to wear a white shirt. I am going to spill SOMUCH freaking tea on my white shirts! This is not cool.But what is cool? This tea. Aw, now that I think of it, I never did get to try it iced! But hot it’s so good, so I’m not complaining ;)Rich and smooth, yet textured and grainy.

I’m not proficient in cooking spices to recognise what it was; a sweet minty smell. Red brown color.

The maltiness, which reminded me of red wine, stood out.A wisp of smoke was present along woth a minty sweet/sour I felt in my outer jaws.Full body yet light and airy. I went ahead and steeped a second time and was glad I did. It may have lost too much for some of the more experienced drinkers, but you will hear no complaints from me. The malt eroded away to even sweeter notes. Something else about this drink; it’s very thirst quenching-no astringency. I have to agree with a post I saw (spoiler) from TeaEqualsBliss where she said it was ‘juicey’. Thanks Pureleaf for this one. I only wish I had enough to drink it all day.

It reminds me of dried pine needles, actually. A little spicy and a touch of cocoa-y yumness. I remember that cocoa note being much stronger though. It’s coming through in the cup, but not really in the leaves.In the cup, I found the funniest strong note, though. A bit like boiling broccoli or green beans. A sort of rough but green note. Weird thing is, I can only find it if I keep my nose at a certain distance from the cup. If it’s too close I just get sweet cocoa, if it’s too far away I get spicy slightly smoky woodness, but at that specific middle distance it’s rough green vegetables with a little butter.This aroma? This aroma <em>alone</em> was so worth waiting for.<em>SLUUUUURRRRRRRP</em>Oh yes. I remember this. The initial very fruity flavour with strong notes of cocoa in it. There is a little smoke on the tail end too, but not too much. It will come. It usually showed up the strongest on the second steep for me.I used plenty of leaf, water gone slightly off boil and a, for me, half-lenght steeping time. Good experiences were made with this method when I had this tea last. Bit expensive on the precious precious leaf, granted, but I dare anybody who’s tried it to tell me it’s not worth it. As a result I’ve got something that has a little astringency. Just a bit at the roof and back of the mouth, and other than that it’s so smooth and lovely. Such a long flavour.The smoke comes through on the aftertaste here, building up gradually as I drink, and the same is happening for the cardboard-y Assam-y quality. Little by little it’s making its presence.How I’ve missed this tea! I grieved and mourned when I used the last of it earlier and finally they have it again. A different year and a different harvest, of course, but this harvest totally measures up the other one. I’m turning it all the way up to a hundred points now. Like <strong>Auggy</strong> said, when I shared it with her, it just has everything as it is. Nothing about this tea can conceivably be improved. You can find stuff that is <em>as</em> good, but nothing that is better. I simply can’t see that happening.It’s <em>THAT</em> good!Now, if anybody needs me, I’ll be in the kitchen drawing little hearts on the label.(I can’t figure out what people mean when they say a tea is ‘chewy’ because chewing a liquid? Really? That doesn’t sound like something I want to do, but I’ve gathered they mean it as a good thing, so maybe this has that too.)', 'Tea of the afternoon……. (SRP #16)Tasting note #700. Wow. I can’t believe it. Which leads me to how this tea came to reside in my cupboard. If you hang around Steepster long enough, you start to get to know other members and their tea loves. I believe this is Angrboda’s all time favorite. It is a Fujian black, which are my favorite black teas. This tea has been on my list for ages, so I splurged on 50g. It arrived today in the mail, just in time for my 700th note. Perfect timing!Oh. Yeah. (I keep hearing that song from ‘Ferris Beuller’s Day Off’ now…) This tea is fabulous. Notes of chocolate, not cocoa-<em>chocolate!</em>, a slightly heavier mouthfeel than others like it (my gong fu blacks), and really tea perfection. I think I want to keep this one around for a while. I stuck with the smaller amount for my first order with TeaSpring since I have a tea inventory problem at home. Once I get a handle on the inventory, I will order more.Usual mug method. (Want more NOW!)', 'With my recent taking to Fujian black teas, I couldn’t wait to try this tea, and thankfully <strong>SimplyJenW</strong> fulfilled that desire by immediately sending me a sample of it! I’m brewing it western style because that’s how I’ve done my other gong fu blacks so far, with parameters that approximate the parameters I’ve used previously, except this one I brewed a little hotter because that’s more like what TeaSpring calls for.From the dry leaf I’m definitely getting molasses and grainy notes, that is, it smells pleasantly like horse grain. I’ve smelled that before from the base of the Tea Spot’s Organic Chocolate “O”, and though I know it doesn’t sound like a compliment, it totally is because I love that smell. I always wanted to eat the horse grain as a kid because it smelled tasty, but of course uncooked grains are not that palatable even when covered in molasses. Anyway, back to the tea. Steeped, I’m smelling more of those cocoa, malty, grainy notes in the cup.Nice grainy, malty, slightly molasses-y, slightly cocoa-y notes in the flavor of this one. It’s also a little less sweet-seeming and a little bolder and a little less smooth than the other gong fu blacks I’ve tried. I’m glad Jen also sent a sample of Keemun Mao Feng, since a few people have mentioned that this tea reminds me of a Keemun without smokiness. I’ve never tried an unflavored Keemun so that will be good to compare. I think Jen nailed it when she said this one was less honeyed and caramelly than the Tan Yang I brought back from China (and I also think Teavivre’s Bailin Gong Fu), but those are some of my favorite parts of the cup. I do have plenty of leaf for this one to try many times and compare side-by-side to some of my other faves, not to mention the others that Jen put in my box (thank you!).I am definitely enjoying this one very much, but it isn’t an easily-acquired replacement for my Tan Yang I brought back from China (of course I knew that going in from Jen’s reviews). I will have to try the higher-grade Tan Yang Jing Zhi from TeaSpring as well at some point.', 'Today is a sad, sad day. I’ve had to decupboard this beauty of a tea. (Much thanks again to Angrboda for the share.) Is it an Assam? Or a Yunnan? Has cocoa been sprinkled on this? And where is that hint of roasty coming from? And is there smoky, too? Surely there isn’t any Lapsang in this…No, it’s just a delightful tea with MPD. But that’s why I love it. That and the fact that no matter which personality shows up in my sip, I know it will always be smooth and sweet and so tasty. It will be missed. So let’s all take a moment of silence to morn for my cupboard, which is now lacking this tea.::cricket::Thank you. Now, in other news, I just bought plane tickets to go to Hawaii so I suppose this day isn’t a total loss, yeah?', 'Delicious. Everything I expected, and more.

A lovely cup for a cold and lonely morning. (Today is a holiday in the US – so most of my office is out). Lovely warm, cocoa-y notes and a complex aroma make this just an amazing cup. Thanks <strong>Angrboda</strong> for this stellar sample.', '<strong>The Final Sipdown: Day 6.5</strong>This tea is incredible.Can I say it again?<em>This tea is incredible</em>.Unlike flavored alcohol, I find that I really appreciate it when I can taste the derivative beverage in a tea. The taste of alcohol makes me cringe. The taste of tea typically has the opposite effect, and so I greatly appreciate it when the taste of the tea and any other flavors it might involve can play together nicely.Let’s begin with the scent of the leaves, shall we? It’s got an earthiness about it, but mainly I smell dark chocolate. I have a large bar of Scharffen Berger sitting upstairs that I use for cooking, and that is what I immediately thought of when I smelled these leaves.The smell of the liquid mimics the leaf scent almost identically, with a bit more of a sweet edge. The chocolate swings between dark chocolate and cocoa.And then the tea…The tea is delicious. Aside from the aforementioned flavors, I get notes of caramel, brown sugar, dates, and pecans. On the aftertaste, there’s just a slight, slight tingle of spiciness. Just enough to <em>imply</em> heat. And it feels like I just indulged in some dark chocolate.Listen, I gulped this cup down before I could really pay attention to it, and while I’d love to go for a second steep I fear that I have too many teas to get through tonight and thus is one of the downsides of TFS.I will, however, say that from what I’ve tasted, this takes whatever chocolatey or desserty teas I’ve tried have attempted to do, and it does it considerably better. It even takes what teas have <em>not</em> necessarily been attempting cocoa or chocolate [one that comes to mind is that dragon ball pearl tea whatever it’s called from Adagio and it makes them look like chumps. <em>Like chumps</em>.I will also say that I am immensely glad that <strong>Auggy</strong> decided I was worth parting with some of her sample from <strong>Angrboda</strong> so that I could try this.

I think of it more as malt and rich, chewy raisins.

Harney’s aroma is malty brown sugar.About 200F was water temp. 1:30 steep time.Scent of steeped leaves: Teavivre was sweet dusty hay, Harney was a smell of cooked, wet leaf and rock.Taste of cup: Teavivre was hay with some malt, mild with a minor, not unwelcome, sour note at the end of the sip. Harney was maltier than TV and sweeter in that brown sugar way, liquor is lighter in color by a touch.Conclusion: I like the Harney better. Granted, however, that the Harney is fresher (2015) and the Teavivre is older (2014). So this wasn’t an optimal taste comparison, probably.

Similar to an Assam—it was clearly malty—but with a definite Chinese red tea flavor profile (somewhat like a Yunnan, possibly in its sweetness?). Good flavor up through the third steeping, some on the forth, with just a hint of flavor on the fifth.<em>Appearance and Aroma of wet leaf</em>: A few largish-looking stems but few broken pieces and plenty of nice buds in the wet leaf; I smelled it just after the first steeping and it had a wonderfully sweet aroma.<em>Value</em>: $3 for the sample, but otherwise $22 / 3OZ. This is clearly a quality tea, but that price-tag is too steep for me (as in, expensive, that is); there are to be plenty of other teashops that carry quality Chinese red teas for a price better than $7/OZ (but maybe none with precisely this kind of flavor profile, <em>hmm</em>?).<em>Overall</em>: I spontaneously brewed up this sample today, it being the last in the bunch I bought from H&amp;S toward the end of last year. On a side note: having now had about ten Teas from H&amp;S I have to say I am impressed with their offerings such that every Tea (NOT including their tizanes) I have tried has been of commendable quality. As I mentioned in <em>Value</em> this is clearly a quality Chinese red tea. Strangely enough in color and flavor this tea somewhat reminds me of a red ale I helped to home-brew just a few days ago; I like that. I am not willing to pay the normal price for this tea, but still, I’m glad I had a chance to experience it.', 'Ever since tasting Teavivre’s Golden Monkey, this kind of Fujian tea has been near the top of my list of plain blacks. I’ve been very curious about it ever since, especially from someone as trustworthy as Harney &amp; Sons.The scent is very fruity and complex, characteristic of this kind of blend. I’m definitely getting the aroma of sweet potato. What’s great about the flavor of this tea is that it’s fruity without being fruit flavored, and it’s so very smooth. There is no bitterness, no astringency. Just delicious, almost breadlike taste. I’m also getting light notes of honey. Truly something to savor.A bit of a warning — this stuff doesn’t like being treated like a traditional black tea. You want to be gentle with it. Give it a shorter steep time and cooler water than you’d usually go with. Otherwise, the flavor gets pretty overwhelming and distorted.And a bit of a random note, I made this for my stoner friend who always wants a cup when I offer, and he said “This is really good tea…” while crashing cars in Grand Theft Auto IV.', '<strong>Jenn</strong> was good enough to send this to me a while back. I’m finally getting to it after sorting out the tea cabinet at home. The dry leaves are golden and dark in color and smell very much like honey! This excites me a little because I love honey. But I hate having to add sweeteners to my tea. I’m finding I like my teas straight up these days. As the tea steeped I continued to get the notes of sweet coming out of the cup. This almost reminded me of a Yunnan I have a large amount of. (Again another good thing!)The taste? Very rich and very bold! I really like it. I have to say I was planning on a nap this afternoon, but I have a feeling this tea will keep me from that. Honestly I’m ok with this, this time. I have a lot to do and a nap would just get in the way.

The instructions said to use 1/2 tsp, but I used my standard 1.5 grams (though increased the water to 8 oz from my usual 6).This was an amazing tea. I was initially hesitant at the Yunnan-like damp forest aroma, but there was an underlying note of cocoa, and I didn’t find it off-putting. The flavor is HUGE. I won’t use as much next time, yet the strength was wonderful: a big, complex, mouth-filling tea. The flavor changed subtly in my mouth and as the cup cooled, making it hard to identify specifics, but it retained the forest/cocoa notes in the nose. The finish was also delightful and strong. A great tea.There is only about 5 grams left in the box, but I’m afraid I’m claiming it.I should probably give this a 100, but I’ve always been a tough grader.', 'Oh my, such a good cup of tea!', 'Here’s Hoping Teabox – Round Seven- Tea #34 The tasting notes for this one are so complex, but I was only tasting the lightest of flavors here. I think these types of golden yunnans are VERY delicious when they are fresh but I think they are the most sensitive tea to aging, as they seem to lose their flavor very fast and end up tasting like cardboard (the other teas most sensitive to age seem to be green teas and definitely Darjeelings). I’m sure this is delicious when fresh, but I’m only tasting light honey notes.', 'This one is a step up from the Yunnan gold tips.  Nose; Sweet potato, butter, honey, tannin, cocoa, citrus note. Palate; Sugar sweet on the tip of the tongue, nice full mouth feel, rich, slight lime, sweet potato, once again that honeyed Darjeeling quality, just a touch of bitterness.', 'Let me begin this review by saying that sometimes I forget what I have in my tea cabinets and storage totes. Literally, I sometimes buy something, put it aside, and then forget about it. I got so wrapped up in finishing off some of the aged oolong samples I had lying around that I totally forgot about this black tea. What’s worse is that I started working my way through this one a couple weeks ago, took a few preliminary notes, and then shoved it far in the back of one of the tea cabinets. I rediscovered it a couple days ago, tested it to make sure it was still viable, and made a point of taking the time to finish it before moving on to something else.I prepared this tea gongfu style. After a quick rinse, I steeped 6 grams of loose tea leaves in 4 ounces of 205 F water for 5 seconds. I followed this infusion up with 15 additional infusions. Steep times for these infusions were as follows: 8 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, 1 minute, 1 minute 15 seconds, 1 minute 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, and 7 minutes.Prior to the rinse, the dry tea leaves gave off mild aromas of camphor, chocolate, and sweet potato. After the rinse, the camphor, chocolate, and sweet potato aromas intensified and were joined by scents of malt, toast, and wood. The first infusion produced a similar, though more balanced bouquet. In the mouth, I mostly picked up mild notes of toast, malt, wood, and sweet potato underscored by subtle notes of chocolate, cream, and camphor. Subsequent infusions were more intense and robust, offering stronger impressions of chocolate, malt, cream, wood, camphor, toast, and sweet potato. Impressions of molasses, baked bread, butter, wildflower honey, and orange emerged at this point. A subtle minerality also began to make its mark on the finish. Later infusions were dominated by impressions of minerals, toast, baked bread, and wood, though fleeting impressions of orange, chocolate, sweet potato, wildflower honey, and camphor lingered in the background.This was a super nice, supremely easy-drinking black tea. I loved how refined the aromas and flavors were, and I thought the smoothness of the body was extremely appealing. This was definitely one of the better black teas I have tried in recent months. I would recommend it highly to anyone looking for a sophisticated Chinese black tea.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Baked Bread, Butter, Camphor, Chocolate, Cream, Malt, Mineral, Molasses, Orange, Sweet Potatoes, Toast, Wood\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'I’m upping my rating. The last time I had this tea, I was back in the midwest for 2 weeks in horribly hot weather in September, with amazing stress levels through the roof. As I had only received a sampler and was constantly interrupted trying to have a morning cup, I didn’t have a decent chance to really think about it, I was just trying to gulp down as much caffeine as I could get.I like this one. I really like this one. If I could realistically afford it, this would be the one I drank most of the time. No bitterness, no astringency. A nice mouth feel, almost creamy or buttery like. A flavor element that makes me think of freshly baked whole wheat bread.Added note – there is a small amount of astringency present once it goes cold. I wonder why that happens as this isn’t the first time I’ve noticed that with a tea.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Baked Bread, Butter, Creamy\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'This was not at all bitter and much less tannic than other black teas I’ve had. I did two western style steeps, the first was 3 minutes and the second was 5.This tea really heated me up inside and got me going. I was amazed how warming it was even after the cup had cooled so perhaps more suited to cooler weather, but it was nice to drink a black tea where I didn’t need to load it up with sugar to be able to drink it. Though I guess there is a sharpness to all black teas that sugar or honey complements. I’m sure a touch of sweet would go well with this.It’s been a few hours since I’ve had the tea and I still feel the effects. Potent stuff! I’m not sure how to rate it yet. I think I can brew it better but definitely one to explore more!', 'Sipdown!Towards the end of the packet, I noticed the leaves weren’t as soft and fuzzy anymore. They became a little more dry and spindly.To be fair, I have had this in my cupboard for a fairly long time and they still tasted pretty much as good as they were.These are absolutely delicious, but it does become weak by the third steep so perhaps I won’t be buying this a third time.I still highly recommend this however.', 'I have had an awful lot of black tea lately, I’m not sure how this happened… I think I’ve had something like six different black teas in the past week and that’s roughly perhaps half of the ones I’ve acquired this past couple of weeks somehow. Anyway, moving on, got this in the $5 sampler that WP is now offering to try their teas, awesome deal.Threw about 4.5 grams in an autobrewer since my attempts at gong fu black tea so far have been a bit discouraging (I think I may be too heavy a steeper). This had a nice, surprisingly floral scent coming from the leaves, which were a bit moist feeling and yet a bit crunchy as well, very unique and pretty. The liquor was an attractive orange brown, the taste was a surprisingly moderate malt flavor that shifted into chocolate with a malt body as you sipped. There was a definite flavor of sweet potato or yam in the second steep along with that touch of raw sour that seems to accompany black tea and potato. The aroma turned floral again, surprisingly, around the third steep, and it became lighter, with a bit of hay. I probably could have pushed it more, but ran out of time and ended this there. I’m going to have to revisit the rest of my sample with a gaiwan soon to see what all I missed out on.Overall, it was quite pleasant and much lighter than I’ve come to expect of black tea, not to mention the surprisingly floral aromas I caught. I’ll need to revisit my other samples to see if this is due to the auto brewer or a character of this tea. There is indeed quite a bit of buzzy energy from this tea, though (either that or a helluva lot of caffeine), as I was a bit frenetically enthusiastic and dropped the lid to my pot a couple of times (thankfully not far) while refilling after the second cup.<b>Additional note amendment, when you push it past three steeps in a gaiwan, it really opens up a crazy sweet sweet potato/yam flavor explosion in the back of the mouth and throat I was NOT expecting on steep 4 as I thought the flavor was fading in the third steep. Floral tastes start standing out late game as well, flavor is more delicate overall. I quite preferred the later steeps, honestly, especially as they lent well to the heavy steeping my intuition generally wants, haha</b>\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Cocoa, Floral, Hay, Malt, Sweet Potatoes\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Whispering Pines had this one down as “The highest grade tea you can find outside of china” or something along those lines. It certainly wasn’t a disappointment. It didn’t have any particular flavor in the foreground which I think was the most appealing thing about this tea. There was some cocoa, a bit of malt, definitely flowers. The main thing i thought about this one is that it is a bit too similar to the other blacks I got from whispering pines, nothing really made this one stand out from the crowd for me, except that it was a pretty balanced, and generally satisfying cup of tea.

During this last month, I’ve ordered from Verdant ‘several’ times (obsessive compulsive &amp; their tea is awesome), &amp; on the most recent order David sent me this sample, with a hand-written label that said “Original Harvest Golden Fleece Sample – Just for fun!”Today is a special day for me. I often joke around about 12 step programs &amp; mysterious substances of my youth. Let’s just say that I was very wild &amp; out of control, at one time, &amp; I suppose you could say I was a connoisseur of sorts, at least in the realm of psychotropic &amp; hallucinogenic substances. I’m not going to say it wasn’t fun, because I had a lot of awesome revelatory experiences, some amazing highs, but there were also lows, which I won’t go into here. I’m sure you’ve heard the saying, “The higher you rise, the farther you fall”.<strong>Today I’m celebrating 29 years clean &amp; serene!</strong> No alcohol, no hallucinogens (believe me, I did enough of those to be able to slip in between realities at will for the rest of my life), no cigarettes, etc, &amp; when you add in food allergies (no dairy, no sugar, no grains (no pastry…sigh…), etc it starts sounding like “No Fun”. <strong>You could say my only vice, my ‘drug of choice’ is tea.</strong> I was contemplating what tea to drink today, &amp; when this sample arrived, I got tears in my eyes, LOL, &amp; gave thanks to the Divine Universe, &amp; to David.I read the instructions on the website. To brew in the Gaiwan or the basket???? I couldn’t decide…So I asked the leaves, &amp; then I went with a hybrid (I’m sure someone is laughing at this point).Dry, I smell a mix of Tobacco &amp; chocolate. The beautiful blond leaves brew into a deep golden honey cup! The flavor is rich &amp; smooth, I think of dark chocolate, but it’s deeper, more earthy. I see an old growth forest, &amp; there is a hint of spice. The 1st 3 steepings were done in my favorite cup with the finnum: 1 min, 2 min, &amp; 3 minutes. There was a sweet undercurrent, which I identified in the 3rd cup as sweet potato. Also, my tongue &amp; throat developed a satisfied sensation as if I’d eaten some really wonderful dark exotic 92% chocolate. The chocolate that isn’t really sweet. All of these steepings were full, dark, &amp; rich!At this point I switched to the gaiwan, so that I could keep steeping these leaves in a smaller amount of water. Now I’m getting a hint of banana bread pudding! I’ve gone through several steepings of this tea, &amp; it is still flavorful, still caramel honey colored. Still tasty.“Onward through the fog”', 'oh hello you gorgeous cup of tea that is so unlike the last cup i had that i bath in the glory that is you. yeah.. that’s right. i’m looking at you…plain old golden fleece, the one that is never as amazing to me as to others…right now? you are my life line. <strong>happy sigh</strong>', 'I feel like I’ve been avoiding this tea subconciously. As if it’s too much of a big deal or something… I went ahead and order 2oz of it, but I don’t want to mess it up or anything. I mean, those two ounces cost me a pretty penny. But I’m going to go for it now, and I’m going to steep it western style (following the instructions on Verdant’s site) because it’s somehow less stressful to me at this point.The dry leaf is beautiful and smells like very fragrant sweet potato chips. I took a big whif and was like, woah! sweet potatoes! Someone came into my office moments after I poured the water on these leaves and asked if I could unlock a door for them, which put me in a panic because I only had a minute to play with. I had a moment of indecision: do I tell them to wait one minute until the steep is done, but the door is just around the corner and that would sound odd anyway. So I walked briskly and I arrived back at my office with 5 seconds to go! Whew.The steeped tea has some of that sweet potato-y aroma, and maybe the slightest hint of vanilla and spices. First sip, after it’s cooled a bit: woah. woah. Sweet, like brown sugar on a baked sweet potato. Sooooo smooth. Just a luxurious, silky, creamy feel to it. With a little tingle in the aftertaste. In the first part of the sip its straight up sweet potato, one that’s been baked to perfection and still has those fresh notes. Then the brown sugar and spices come sliding in… I mean, not spices so much as the faint hint of allspice perhaps. The after taste is light, and more of a sensation than a taste, a light tingling that is really intriguing. Really an amazing Dian Hong, and if you are a fan of that varietal you owe it to yourself to get a bit of this tea. Can’t wait to gong fu this one and see its performance there!', 'I guess I’ll be the first civilian foolish enough to talk about this tea.As soon as you unseal the bag and get that heady aroma that’s been trapped in there, you know you’re in for something different.I actually got out a kitchen scale, weighed my gaiwan, and then weighed in David’s recommended gram of leaf per fluid ounce of the vessel.Uncharacteristic of myself, I even gave the leaves a rinse so that I could ensure the first steeping I drank came off “awake” leaves.The aroma off the wet leaves will leave you speechless. It is like that sensation you get when you walk into a humidor. I don’t mean the tea smells like cigars, although, to some extent I think perhaps it does, what I mean is that there is a particular physical sensation that goes beyond smell, when you walk into the damp, close, still, thickly scented air of a humidor. And smelling this tea leaf once wet, is like that.With the first steep I understand what Geoffrey and David have been describing in terms of texture. Drinking this tea reminds me of the sensation one gets in the mouth after engaging in wuji qigong for the better part of an hour. There is at the same time a thickness of the mouth but your mouth is watering at the same time. I’ve now been typing, and taking a conference call, and haven’t sipped the tea for perhaps ten minutes and my sinuses are still registering all the aromas and tingling sensations and my mouth is still watering and thick.I can actually feel the small heavenly circle flowing rapidly and if I were to stand up and correct my posture, I suspect the grand heavenly circle would open up almost immediately.My ears are ringing.I actually need to wait a few steeps to even begin using adjectives to describe the aromas off the leaf or the cup or the flavors from the liqueur. Neither my mouth nor my brain are entirely awake right now and I know that strictly speaking neither is this tea. So, expect a follow up later today with all kinds of pretentious wine tasting words in it.', 'I’m feeling much better now. My cold is almost gone after a miserable 6 days. My house is clean, BoxerPapa isn’t much of a house keeper. The dogs and I went for a walk. I’m tired now though, so I’m going to watch a movie and see how many steeps I can get out of this lovely tea.  I get cravings for it, I’ve never tasted anything like it. It’s like a sweet potato casserole. Sweet and creamy with a hint of cinnamon. Today is a great day!', 'I feel very lucky to have received this gift of tea. So lucky, I have not wanted to write about this tea. What can I say about it that has not been said? To speak would imply judgement, and how can I pass judgement over a gift such as this? I am happy to drink and learn.I can say nothing but Thank You.It’s a pleasure to meet you, Golden Fleece. I am thoroughly enjoying our time together.', 'I may have committed a crime against the tea gods, but I figured I should write about it because it was a good experience.Last night I decided to use the last 4 grams of my sample of this amazing tea. It was late and I had homework but I had had a long day and needed to relax. I went through about 12 steepings, right around where it starts weakening, when my brother needed help with the computer. I knew I wouldn’t get a chance to squeeze the last drops out of this tea so I threw it in my teavana perfect brewer with some breakfast black and let it steep. I wasn’t expecting to notice anything about the Golden Fleece because I had already drained a lot of it’s flavor, and I use a pretty strong breakfast black brew. I was blown away by the first sip. It had the typical deep rich breakfast black flavor that it always has, but the Golden Fleece was coming through very strong. The first thing I noticed was it smoothed out both the flavor and the mouth feel of the tea. It didn’t have nearly as much “kick” as the breakfast black normally has. It also acted almost like a tea flavored sweetener. I could clearly taste brown sugar and cinnamon, which removed any bitterness that the breakfast black had before. It was the best cup of BB I have ever had. I almost want to go looking for an inexpensive, sweet, and smooth tea like golden fleece to throw a couple grams in the bottom of my breakfast blacks.', 'Golden Fleece round 2, fight!As I mentioned in my last note, I cold brewed my leaves from yesterday. I did 4 short steeps in my fish gaiwan so I knew there was more than enough flavor left in here for a cold brew! And I know some people must be thinking it’s crazy to cold brew leaves like this but let me tell you, I am a cold brew addict. I do it to almost every tea that crosses my path, and 90% of the time I prefer them that way! Teas can taste quite different with this brewing method and I tend to like the sweeter, softer notes that it brings out.The liquid after a 12 hour steep is… well, it’s golden! My steeps last night were much darker, a murky brown even with super short steeps, but this time it’s a stunning color. Liquid gold!And the flavor… oh my. Hello, Golden Fleece! It smells like fresh pastries, brioche buns hot out of the oven. I think I am finally seeing (well, tasting) what all the fuss was about! This is liquid honey, soft and floral (yes, floral, from a Dian Hong!), faint notes of citrus and malt. Orange blossom, and the end of the sip is almost custardy. This is Fabulous with a capitol F. I think I’m in love… which is unfortunate given how pricey this is and, you know, the fact that even if I could afford it, Golden Fleece is sold out!', 'I feel like I shouldn’t even be talking about this tea. There’s really no telling whether we’re ever going to see it again. The Golden Fleece, true to name, has already developed a mythic eminence among those few who’ve had the opportunity to experience it. “Why?” is a question that recurs often. <em>Why… this inexplicable privilege?</em> And the apparent difficulty of obtaining even a small quantity of this stuff only intensified the pounding I felt in my heart at the prospect of parting with any of it. Truly, when we realized how little there was, the temptation to tell no one and keep this tea to ourselves was very strong. But David was adamant, and the best part of me completely agreed, that to not share this tea would do it dishonor.It has been my good fortune and great pleasure to try many inspiring teas, but this Dian Hong, which we came to call the Golden Fleece, immediately stood apart as one of the finest things I’ve ever had the chance to drink. I’m sure this will all inevitably sound hyperbolic, and in any case, it is known that I’m nothing close to an unbiased source on these matters… But I just want to say, for whatever it’s worth, I’m writing this in earnest as an endeavor to draw out and unburden myself from the weight of the inspiration this tea has placed inside me. Apart from that, I can’t see any other gain in writing about a tea that we don’t have, and perhaps may never be able to obtain again. Whatever the case, I must speak… it can’t be helped.A little back story. David first told me of this tea about a month and a half ago, while we were still hard at work getting the new Verdant website together. I was surprised to hear him emphatically going on about “the most exquisite Dian Hong I’ve ever seen”. It’s not common to hear David talk about black teas in this manner; most often he’s praising a Sheng Pu’er or a Dancong that has recently inspired him. I probably reach for the black teas far more often than he does, so this got my attention; but I was so busy at work on the website that I kind of had to forget about it.Anyway, we finally got around to staying after work one Friday evening to relax and drink some teas, and he brought the sample of this Dian Hong out for us to try first. I remembered how he told me that the tea buds of this Dian Hong were extraordinarily beautiful. Indeed, on inspecting the plump buds closely I was struck by their beauty. Light shined off of them, glowing and golden, giving the appearance of something very precious. (Note: photos have yet to do them justice.) I observed closer and commented about how the downy filaments on the surface of these buds looked unreal, like I wasn’t even looking at tea, but rather was looking at the fleece of some enchanted mythical creature. Now, none of us really remember who said it first, but perhaps it’s most correct to say that the words appeared somewhere between the three people present at that drinking session. What we do know is that one of us then uttered the words “Golden Fleece”, at which point we all looked at each other and agreed that we couldn’t call this tea by any other name from that moment forward.So then David brewed it. I took a good ten or fifteen seconds just to appreciate the aroma of it in my cup. As a serious fan of gourmet mushrooms, I melted in the sensation of this fragrance, which was like walking into a large room where a master chef was laboring to perfect the finest mushroom soup anyone had ever prepared. I gazed into the pure, liquid gold color of the liquor and imagined all the very best qualities of morel, chanterelle and truffle mushrooms synthesized to perfection. First sip… a moment of silence… then the only comment I could make…<em>“It’s not even fair.”</em>The texture of silk, a delicate effervescence, as if an exquisite sauce had been made from the very spirit of Yunnan and poured over that platter of incredible mushrooms. An incomparable tea. Only a few sips of this heady brew and I was tea drunk. The tail and aftertaste revealed a sweetness like vanilla and honey. These sweet things seem far away from the savory qualities described above, but somehow this tea manages to bridge, no… encompass the spectrum of all these flavors in a way that is completely integrated, and hard to comprehend. But how it works doesn’t need to be understood, because it works so magnificently. Further cups had me writing notes such as: feathery, lush, luxurious. And the spice of this tea, it’s like pepper, cinnamon and clove, but it doesn’t bite you – which I mean in the best way. The image that comes to mind is of a large and powerful enchanted creature (something like the forest spirit in Princess Mononoke) that has amazingly soft fur, and is completely at peace with letting you nuzzle and rest against it. That’s what this tea is like for me… an encounter with the forest spirit of Yunnan.It’s only appropriate to know that all of this was wild-picked in Xishuangbanna. I asked David where Wang Yanxin could have possibly found such a tea, and he said she didn’t explain much about that first sample she sent us. She only sent this one Dian Hong and wrote on the label, “This is the one. Best Dian Hong. Taste slowly.” Indeed. There was no question in my mind about whether we should try to get more. Although, the possibility of sourcing this tea did raise some questions. We don’t do grades of tea; it just doesn’t fit into the curatorial rigor of our selection process and goal for the Verdant collection to carry more than one representative of a given tea, unless they’re expressing dramatically different things. We were already carrying another very good Dian Hong at an attractive price point, and it was popular. The Golden Fleece, because of its rarity, would have to be twice the price of our Yunnan Golden Buds. And at that point, we didn’t really know how much of the Golden Fleece we’d be able to acquire, much less how much was harvested to begin with.After some careful deliberation, it was decided that the Golden Fleece was just so outstanding and unique that an exception could be made to source some quantity of it as a special limited offering alongside our other Dian Hong. The price and uncertain supply factors certainly made it out of the question for Golden Fleece to replace our other Dian Hong. And in any case, we found them distinct enough to exist side-by-side in a way that could be justified. So we ordered about ten pounds to be included in what was our next shipment at the time.I vividly remember the day it arrived. I had more anticipation for Golden Fleece that just about anything else in the shipment. We were going through the box of sealed tea packages and pulled out all the ones that were labelled as wild-picked Yunnan budset tea. The red bags piled up in our office. We opened one of them to check, and in the first one found the Wild-Picked Yunnan Jin Jun Mei we ordered. Then we opened another bag and there was the Golden Fleece. The two Yunnan black teas were sent in the same colored bags with similar labels.Anyway, I went home that night a bit drunk on the thought that we’d secured ten pounds of Golden Fleece. But then… The next morning I came to the office and David gave me the news. “I did a thorough inventory of the shipment last night, and it turns out that there’s only two pounds of Golden Fleece. The rest is the Jin Jun Mei.” Two pounds. That’s all we could get, and all that was available apparently. “Will we ever be able to get more?” I asked. David gave the answer I was most unprepared to hear, “Honestly, it’s impossible to say one way or another. When these two pounds are gone, we may never see this tea again.” It was at this point that the temptation to keep it all to ourselves had to be fought.When you love something, and know how ephemeral your time with it is… that one day soon it will be gone… that it may never come back… and you’ll only be left with a memory to treasure… perhaps a pang of nostalgia… Well, let’s just say that it took some strength to come to grips with the situation, and accept the circumstances as they were. Ultimately, David made the point, which I already knew deep inside of me, that we should be grateful to have had the privilege to taste such a tea even one time – and not take that for granted.That week we had scheduled a tea tasting for about sixteen guests at our office, and we had raised some anticipation for these attendees to try the Golden Fleece and purchase some if they wished to. It was before we understood how little supply we had. The day before that tasting, we were due to make the Golden Fleece available for purchase on the website, and I had to lobby with David for setting aside an appropriate amount of the tea to be available for our local guests. After that was done, we put Golden Fleece on the website with the limit of a two ounce maximum quantity per person and watched it sell out in a few hours. The most limited-edition tea we’ve ever carried.As expected, the Golden Fleece we set aside for our local tasting was nearly cleaned out by the end of the night. I like to remember how, when we brewed it for everyone, a good friend of ours was at the end of the table and I only had about half a sip left in the serving pitcher to pour for him on the first round. He was still grateful, and appreciated what he had before him with no less care. This particular friend is a flavor aficionado, with highly developed taste from many years of developing an amazing talent for cooking, as well as from taste training in fine wines. The look on his face when he took that little sip for the first time… how to describe it? He ruffled his brow in a kind of quiet shock and consternation mixed with obvious signs of deep pleasure. He turned his face to me, wide-eyed, and whispered, “…the texture …this is wrong.” To which I replied, “Like I said… it’s not even fair.” He nodded, quietly repeating the words to himself.I’ve now had four sessions with this tea, always preparing it gongfu style in a gaiwan. It blows me away every time, and what further bewilders me is that none of us have yet managed to exhaust all the flavor from the buds. I’ve steeped it out over twenty times in a given session and it just keeps going, even into the next day. We always get waterlogged long before we’re able to make the buds reach their limit… if they have a limit at all. My mother picked up some of this at our tasting, and she told me that she recently re-steeped it many times over for three days. The further I go into a session with this tea, the more its headiness gets to me; and in my tea-drunk musings I start to imagine that I’ll never reach the end of it… because it really may just be some enchanted mythic thing that always keeps one of its feet firmly planted in eternity.There has been rumor from Wang Yanxin that we may be able to secure more of the Golden Fleece. But after all that’s happened, I’m not sure I’m going to really believe it until I see it. At any rate… if by some grace it does become available again, I can only suggest that you try some while you can – and taste slowly.', 'I FINALLY (after like 2+ years on here) got a gaiwan! I was making a Butiki order and they had a spouted one (the safest choice for my clumsy self) so I sprung for it. It is absolutely perfect for me – I love that it’s stoneware instead of porcelain and I love the way it pours, and that it is about 4 oz. Now I can finally do some gongfu and really get the most out of my leaves!Verdant’s teas are all perfect for gaiwans, so I decided to start with Golden Fleece since I haven’t had it in a while. I was weighing out the leaves (per Verdant’s instructions, so 4 grams) and really, just holding it in your hands is a sensory experience in itself. They are so soft and feathery/fuzzy, and also super fragile looking. I want to keep them long and spindly so I’m fighting the urge to handle them too much.1st steep= maybe 10 seconds? The predominant smell of the steeped leaves is peppery and kind of burnt – like very crispy potatoes. It was super hot so at first I didn’t get much taste. Just that smooth silky texture on my tongue. There was a pepper note after I swallowed and as the cup cooled down I could pick up honey and pepper together. Sweet and savory and silky. This steep seemed kind of delicate and light in flavor.2nd steep = 15 seconds. The leaf smells sweeter now – honey, vanilla, cinnamon. The tea is darker, but still as smooth. This is mostly sweet – all honey but there is an umami-like bite at the end of the sip. Now that I’ve thought about it as umami, all I can think is that the liquor itself smells brothy. It’s as if somehow this manages to do everything at the same time – the only thing that changes is what flavor you choose to pay attention to.3rd steep = 25 seconds. The leaf is back to smelling like potatoes and the taste is all umami + pepper. There is quite a bite at the end of these sips! I am starting to specifically identify the broad “umami” taste as more mushroom. Well, wait – the liquor smells like vanilla and honey, now. And tastes like it too, since its cooled.4th steep = 45 seconds. Now it tastes like potatoes. Starchy but still amazingly smooth. This has plenty of flavor left in it but I think I’ll give it a rest for right now. Yay for gaiwans! I can’t wait to put these leaves through all of their paces!I didn’t rate this numerically the first time I had it, but I feel like since I’ve tried it both ways I can do so now. Unsurprisingly it’s going to be pretty high. A very yummy Yunnan, for sure!'], 'Polarity': [0.2790761904761904, 0.33095238095238094, 0.17000000000000004, 0.018185550082101803, 0.1606060606060606, 0.39444444444444443, 0.2152460317460317, -0.016666666666666666, 0.19394970353501156, 0.24694895382395385], 'Mouthfeel': '', 'Flavor Profile': {'Spicy': 0.5263157894736842, 'Char': 0.0, 'Sweet': 0.3684210526315789, 'Nutty': 0.05263157894736842, 'Floral': 0.05263157894736842, 'Herbs': 0.0, 'Vegetables': 0.0, 'Grass': 0.0, 'Wood': 0.0, 'Earth': 0.0, 'Mineral': 0.0, 'Marine': 0.0, 'Berry': 0.0, 'Citrus': 0.0, 'Tree Fruit': 0.0, 'Tropical': 0.0}}\n",

That’s this tea in a nutshell, really.A short while ago I alluded to having been exposed to some really awesome customer service and I’ve been sitting on that story until I actually had some tea from the company in question. See, here’s the thing. I have been priviledged enough to have Steepster friends who have shared with me samples of Shang Tea’s products. Each and every one I’ve tried have impressed me. (This may have something to do with their teas being Fujian teas, which have I ever mentioned is my favourite tea producing area?) Anyway, it was only natural that I should go and look up their website, just on the off chance that shipping to Europe wouldn’t be horrible. There was a mention of a flat rate which sounded cool, but not about which area that covered.So I sent them an email, asking about it and what it would cost to ship something to Denmark. Unfortunately their reply said something in the vicinity of $40… I coughed, hacked and resigned myself to the fact that I would have to use kindly disposed Steepsterites as middle men if I were to buy any of their stuff. This is the reason I have a tendency to not bother looking up American companies before automatically assuming them out of my reach. $40 was on the high end yes, but in general American companies who can ship at a for me reasonable shipping fee are few and far between. No tea is good enough for me to want to pay more than $15 for shipping as the very most.Time passed. I got over it. I forgot about it. Then one morning I woke up to an email from Shang Tea saying ‘o hai, in response to your previous question two months ago, we looked into it and can now offer you shipping at around $13 dollars to Denmark. Would you like to buy some tea? Email order, paypal money and so on and so forth.’ Or something to that effect.That was quite a shipping fee difference! And just the fact that they answered my question and still proceeded, without my begging or prompting or wheedling or anything, to see if they couldn’t do me one better. I’m very impressed with this, and I’m going to come back for more if they will let me shop that way again. (The order form on their site wouldn’t accept a non-American address).I picked up the package yesterday from the post office and have tinned two of them this morning. There are still two other pouches in there that I’m not allowed to open until I’ve freed up tins, but I can deal with that.And that is how I came to share a pot of Golden Needle King with the boyfriend this morning. Isn’t this just a wonderful tea? It’s all smooth and slippery and dark in flavour. It’s almost ever so slightly milky. Lots and lots of that Fujian-ness that makes it my favourite area. Grainy with dark fruity and spicy notes to it. Lots of cocoa notes as well and a caramel-like aftertaste.Steepsterites, go try this one out for yourselves. I implore you. It’s pricy, but you will NOT regret it. And on the off-chance that you do, feel free to punish me for leading you astray by making me use up the rest of your leaves. :)', 'Took me a moment to find this here on steepster because my sample package says “Golden Needle Red Tea” not Golden Needle King – but the description is the same so I will log it here:Well I steeped this completely wrong – forgot to let water cool one minute as package says to do. Got into a convo with hubby and just absent mindedly poured the boiling water over the leaves. Uggg I expected problems in the flavor from this. In a panic I added a little extra cool water – I guess thinking to bring the temp down slightly. Then I realized what I had done and was just like Ugggggggg whatever – it was my only sample I had to drink it. To waste a precious tea from Shang would be a sin…a SIN I tell you!  So anyway guess what – quality tea can take a beating! This was still fabulous!  The smell was malty and of cocoa. The taste was of molasses, malt, chocolate, and hay.  The hay and molasses combination reminded me of sorghum I think. It brought back memories of when I trained hoses and had a couple of my own. That sticky sweet grain we fed the horses in fall and winter. I have not been reminded of that aroma for years and years. It brought back nice memories and made me miss those days. How I love the smell of hay and sweet grain, and horses. Okay before I turn everyone off to this tea the main flavors and aromas are that of malt, chocolate, and molasses, not horses, or hay, but there is something about this tea that makes me want to go to the country and jump on a horse!  This tea also provided a slight albeit very slight cinnamon sparkling sensation on the tongue.  I found this tea quite filling – almost like a dietary supplement may fill your tummy up except this was far more filling and far more enjoyable than those things!  Second and third steeps were also quite excellent but it was getting late and I laid the leaves out for morning – ended up not re-steeping well the next day (today) but I probably ruined a forth steep by over heating the water the first time around.  Shang has THE best teas in my opinion among maybe 5 other tea companies. Love this stuff!', 'It’s a sad state of affairs when one’s crazy work life prevents one from trying new teas. It is an absolute tragedy that my abbreviated routine prevented me from trying this wonderful tea for more than a month. Wombatgirl is right. This is an excellent substitute for Dawn tea. One sip this morning and I was delighting in the sweetness and notes of cocoa and caramel.After the second sip I ran to the kitchen to get the package so that I could immediately order a quantity of it from Shang Tea. If there is anything the Dawn tea debacle convinced me of it is that the right time to lose oneself in tea is the present moment and the right time to buy a tea one loves is immediately lest they run out or go out of business.It is quite, quite good. I’m so very glad my life slowed down enough for me to try it.', 'This is the second red tea I’ve had in the last week (the other one was at Taste SF – a local tea place) and I’ve discovered I like them!This steeps up to be a beautiful reddish-brown and it has a cocoa and cinnamon aroma. I am very intrigued by it since it is made of fermented white tea leaves. It definitely has a smooth and delicate quality but it also a bit malty and chocolate-y, slightly fruity. Reminds me a bit of a golden yunnan… also resteeps wellOn a side note I discovered my new $20 Bodum tea for one set is made out of plastic and not glass, and I really don’t like the way tea tastes in plastic… boo', 'Resteep. This time around it’s like honey on bread. Most of the darker flavors are gone but all the middling ones are still there so the cup doesn’t feel too thin. There’s a surprisingly syrupy mouthfeel this time around that I’m liking; it matches the honey flavor well.', 'Loose Appearance: crinkle, curly bicolor, deep black leaf Aroma when Dry: salty, vegital After water is first poured: intensely floral At end of first steep: floral, vegital Tea liquor:  At beginning of steep: muddy green Staple?

This is lovely. I bought this packet from their shop in downtown KC, and it’s labeled there as Golden Needle Red Tea, rather than Golden Needle King, but per their site it looks like the same thing.This, ladies and gentlemen, might be a good replacement for Dawn from the Simple Leaf. Opening the packet I got a giant whiff of cocoa. Yum! It’s a lighter colored tea, since it’s a red tea, but it’s VERY flavorful. It’s got tones of cocoa and pepper and something that makes me think of autum leaves, but in a really good way.I did this at approx. 190 for 2 minutes. It was made of awesome.', 'Yet another one from my white tea sampler from Shang. But this was “technically” not a white tea. I say that because it actually falls in the black tea category. Squarely. In appearance, it looked like a pre-QingMing Keemun Mao Feng. The liquor colored similar to a Golden Yunnan amber. Aroma and taste, however, were quite the oddity. This tasted like the description – a lightly fermented white tea, as if someone took a batch of Bai Mu Dan and steeped it for eight-to-ten minutes. (Without spinaching, of course.) There’s a bit of a nectarine texture to it, but minor compared to a Yunnan Gold. Still a mighty pleasant drink.', 'Wow, I’m already out and I don’t have a tasting note? Must be good tea then!Smells of malt and spices, a really pleasant aroma. In addition I am getting just a hint of some sort of fruit as well. I love to simply hold the cup under my nose and inhale. Taste is a very pleasant combination of white and red tea. As much as I liked the Bai Lin Kung Fu from Shang Tea, I think this is better.For a red tea this is pretty mild. The reason being this is (as stated on the package) made from white tea leaves.Taste is less malty than the smell, it resembles their silver needle king and yet is obviously changed at the same time by the fermentation process. This is a wonderful special occasion tea in which you will not realize you have drank it all if you are not careful. Highly recommended!I am typically able to get around 3 steepings from this, unlike other red teas which you seem to start suffering at around two steepings.', 'A great start to the morning, this black tea offering from Shang is pretty good and is on the lighter side of the black tea spectrum since it is made using his white tea leaves.', 'Has become my go-to daily drink. I love this tea. Brisk, full, lovely color, smooth and good hot or cold. Fantastic quality tea.', 'This is a special and delicious red tea: sort of radiant, energetic, warm, and almost sweet but not quite. I suspect that the fact that it’s made from the white tea plant contributes to its special, elevated and elevating quality.', 'Backlogging I got this from either Azzrian or Nicole in of the free christmas offers. Sorry I am not good at keeping track sometimes who specificly sends me a tea. So please I hope you don’t feel insulted or offended. Thank you very much for gifting me this.This is a good tasting black tea that is a tad strong to what I used to. Its still good though and kind of tastes like a yunnan tea. And has a good brisk flavor. And I did add some sugar.', 'The first time I tried this, any cocoa notes eluded me, sadly. It was fine, a nice tea, but nothing to justify the price tag. The second time around, I got the cocoa and flavor explosion and I’m not sure what the difference was. Lower than boiling temperature with shorter steep? I think that was it. Really a beautifully smooth and complex tea for those moments where I can appreciate more in a tea.', 'Very strong read – high caffeine, great start for mornings!', 'Sip down. I needed something thick like a black tea, and nuanced like a white, so this was the best option I had to finish. Cocoa and bready goodness is present dry, and enhanced brewed. First few steeps had light amber, malt, and honey in the profile. Caramel came up in steep two, and the grain notes typical of a Shang Tea popped up. I got the lychee in the third steep, but the rose quality was not really there, but there was an aftertaste that reminded of rose water texture. The tea was always viscous, and as everyone else has said, this hong cha is a refined lighter one.Again, I think that this tea is something that everyone on here should try especially if you are looking to see what Black can offer. My only hesitation is the price, but then again, you would not want to drink this tea all the time. I personally can only drink it if I am in the mood for it.This is one of the better hong cha’s I’ve had, but it’s not the best in my opinion. I agree with the consensus on this one and will rate it an 88.', 'Thank you TeaTiff for this one a while back! The sample pouch had a not-at-all full two teaspoons so I went with that. I thought this was supposed to be one of those golden teas because of the name, but it almost looks like Teavivre’s Bailin Gongfu. The leaves are dark with only hints of gold occasionally and smell very grassy. The flavor seems to be the Bailin mixed with a high quality keemun. There is a lovely almost floral like fragrance even before taking a sip from this rusty colored cup. Keemun is always tough for me to describe. But the flavor is delicious — a medium bodied taste, but no smoke like a keemun. It’s like flowers, wine, biscuits, hay. Really it reminds be of Teavivre’s highest quality keemun mixed with their Bailin. The second steep seemed a little too much at those parameters. I thought it was a mistake on the packaging that is called a white tea and a red tea but it’s actually made from a white tea plant? But I thought all tea comes from the same plant anyway? It was good and then it was gone. Steep #1 // 2 tsps. // 12 min after boiling // 2 min Steep #2 // just boiled // 3-4 min', 'I’ve had this tea quite a while. I usually don’t think to review Shang Teas because I am impressed by really everything they offer and have at one time or another owned most of their teas. I don’t need to rate and review them to know them well. I’ve become pretty connected to them. I forget that others might like to know about their qualities. This review comes in the wake of a yixing crisis that led me to rediscover this tea.If I’ve caught any of you yixing lovers’ attention now, what I mean is that I recently got a new yixing pot. I’ve been using it a few weeks now with some Gui Fei oolong, and while it has built up the most caramely, rich, sweet aroma and flavor, I have to admit I found myself wondering if the tea was really as good as I remember it from when I first brewed it in a gaiwan, so I got out my gaiwan and tried it in there. Sure enough, it was better than in the yixing pot. Whaaaat? I was sure I’d used it enough to be seasoned and not still extracting flavor?Research led me to find that the type of yixing pot I have is thick-walled and low fired, so not only is the heat retention a bit too high for greener oolongs, but it is porous enough to steal their aroma. I had to put a lot of thought into how to re-season my yixing pot as the shape and thickness and clay type of it make it ideal for high-temperature teas, particularly red tea or puer. I don’t really drink a lot of either, so I had to decide which one I’d enjoy having more often and enjoy exploring more of (and sharing with friends). I went with red since I thought it would be better complemented by the sweetness already built up in the pot from the Gui Fei, and a friend mentioned the red color of the tea would complement the blue yixing clay well, which I agree with immensely. I’m reminded of Icelandic volcanoes when pouring the deep red-orange drops from the deep blue pot that is etched with a golden crackle design.So out comes the golden needle to re-season the pot. It took to it well and blended well with the sweetness from the gui fei as I thought it would. I did the “un-seasoning” process of boiling it in just water for about half an hour to get the original tea scents I used in it out, but it only half did the job. I knew it wasn’t all gonna come out. Either way, it works well and in time it will grow to be more distinctly “red” and less “sweet oolong”.As for this golden needle, it is really a mellow tea, even when using a lot of leaf. The flavor is light and there is really no bitterness or astringency in it like you might find in some Yunnan red teas. It’s just smooth and zen, the slightest bit tart. The flavor is malty and really this is one of those teas that isn’t super flashy with elaborate notes. This is a tea that tastes like tea and in that since it is humbling and simple, easy to appreciate. It has a little note of lychee, though that may be a lingering effect of the Gui Fei I had in this pot before, which has strong lychee notes.There are also little hints of dried fruit.The second infusion of this tea is my favorite. It is rather sweet and syrupy. Really flavorful and forgiving. No bitterness or drying sensation. It’s a very juicy red tea, a real joy to drink. This could easily be a real favorite of mine if it was a hint sweeter, but I’m not about to go make it in a mug with some sugar. It’s great just how it is.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Dried Fruit, Lychee, Malt, Tea\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'I must say, while this is definitely a delicious black tea with the aroma of honey, it is a little bit too ‘dark’ for my tastes. By ‘dark’ I probably mean bold, but also slightly bitter and tannic-y? I wish I knew what I mean most of the time.Anyway, there’s just something about this tea that doesn’t sit well with me. I think what happened is that I actually brewed it wrong, overleafed or oversteeped. I am not sure. I think I will try to resteep the leaves for a rather short time and see what comes out of it.EDIT: Okay, so I let the re-steep brew for 2 minutes. Now the tea came out a little on the bland side but it doesn’t have these bitter elements in it that I didn’t enjoy. I think I will have to brew it at a slightly colder temp next time for a shorter time with less leaf. I am not rating it yet either.', 'From HH TTB 2.This was a white tea? Huh. I totally didn’t get that. I had it pegged as a black and was comparing it in my head to other medium bodied blacks.But hey, if it’s a white, I think it reminds me a bit of White Rhino. I liked it, and I was excited to try it since this brand is new to me but usually reviewed well on here. I drank the last little bit in the box so I’ll try to get another steep out of it.', '<strong>Nicole</strong> recommended that I go visit <strong>Shang Tea</strong> while I’m in Kansas City, so we drove there this morning to see what they had to offer. There was a very nice man working there who brewed us up some samples to try and seemed very knowledgeable about their teas. I noticed later that there was a photo on the wall of him in the tea fields. Apparently he goes there about 2 or 3 months out of the year, he told us. I’m not sure whether he was the owner or not, but he was very nice and I wish I had asked him his name. I ended up buying samples of several different teas and a box of some interesting-looking instant mix.So I ended up steeping this tea three times throughout the day, the first at 3 minutes, then 4 and 5 for the other two. I think this may be the first tea I’ve had that I’ve enjoyed the second and third steeping more than the first. Honestly, I don’t remember that much about the first, as it was in the afternoon. I would describe it as a mixture of black and white teas. The second and (especially) the third steepings were fantastic, with an amazing creamy grain note that reminds me of something, but I can’t quite place it. I would call it similar to rice or cereal grains, and there’s a bit of a hay note as well. The texture is creamy and light. Yum! I may have to try for a fourth steep in the morning…\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Baked Bread, Grain, Hay, Honey, Molasses\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'I received this in a swap from TeaTiff. Thanks so much for introducing me to Shang! This is a really interesting tea. According to Shang this is made from a white tea bush, which likely explains the “difference” I taste in this. It’s a bit hard for me to describe that difference, but it is so very good. It brews up a reddish amber cup with with a bready, sugary aroma. The first sip is sweet. Brown sugar sweet with a pleasant malty note that becomes a bit more prominent as it cools. This is <strong>pretty</strong> tea.

That insanely cocoa-y tea had become a minor obsession, as I compulsively checked the New Arrivals section of Upton’s site almost daily, knowing full well that, barring a miracle, it would not be restocked until late fall. If ever.Zhi’s Gong Fu Black is, so help me, the identical twin of Panyang Bohea Supreme: rich, naturally cocoa-y to the max, little to no astringency. To me this is the pinnacle of what Chinese black teas, particularly Fujians, can be. And because it is readily available, I am able to stop my frantic stock-checking, relax and enjoy a pot of it whenever I like.As I take stock of the many blessings in my life, I must include this remarkable tea among them. Thank you for restoring my mental health, Gong Fu Black! And a million thank-yous, Zhi Tea, for offering it!', 'I am finally finishing off my sample of this tea that MzPriss sent me a while back.Today wasn’t a good day for me, I’ve felt bad all day with a stomach virus of some kind and the weather here has been freakishly hot. I really haven’t done much aside from sleep and am having my first cup of tea now at almost 5:30.This is super nice and chocolate-y tasting, smooth and delicious. I could definitely see myself buying some of this if I placed an order with Zhi at some point in the future. Right now I am wondering what other tea I can drink that might be easy on my tummy since I will probably stop with the caffeine here. Maybe ginger would be good.', 'Many, many thanks to SimplyJenW for this nice surprise tea! Youngest and I decided to try it with our lunch today, which I’ll momentarily be followed by Rich Tea Biscuits with Nutella and MORE TEA!

I took mine sans additions, youngest with milk and sugar.Thank you, Jen!', 'Thank you, <strong>justnord</strong>, for swapping with me for this tea! This is really nice. It reminds me of very much of Laoshan Black. It is chocolatey and fruity with very low astringency. I believe that Laoshan Black was sweeter and more complex than this, but now I’m going to have to do a side-by-side comparison soon! I really enjoyed having this with one of my current vices- Gardein Chick’n Sliders. :-)', 'This leaf produces a scrumptious comforting cup of tea. The dry leaves are twisted black (with a little gold thrown in) wires with a very pleasant dark-chocolate fruit aroma.

What a random coincidence. I definitely didn’t name this tea with the show in mind but that is kind of cool. The name of the tea is a nod to one of my husband’s hobbies, Magic: The Gathering. The most prized card in that game is the black lotus card, so I thought it would be fun to name this tea that.

Moving out some old teas, preparing for some new ones. I love changing things up and constantly looking for higher quality and making more interesting flavors. There is no room for average teas.

I’m over the bulk of the crud, but the cough is driving me nuts. Throughout the the last two weeks I’ve lived off mostly Laoshan Black, Wild Mountain Black, and Tawainese assams.It was time to change it up a bit today, but not by much. This is still my favorite English Breakfast tea, and Verdants Imperial Breakfast Blend is my other favorite breakfast blend. Probably because they each have a base of my two favorite teas. Laoshan Black and the Taiwanese Assam.I have a million teas, I’m too afraid to count the actual number, but over the past few months since life has gotten so busy, I really only drink about 10 of them.

I’ve been hanging around here for a good 3 years now!I had another hard night at work – our floor is full of such heavy acuity kids right now I feel like I’m running all night long. Luckily I’ve got a night to recuperate before signing on for 2 more. Plus, it is SO COLD outside. Supposed to flurry later tonight/tomorrow morning, even, though it would be better if it didn’t. Georgians simply don’t know what to do with snow or ice.So I couldn’t just go off to sleep without getting a cup of tea to warm/relax me. I wanted a black tea, no added flavors but strong. This one I got from Stacy’s Black Friday sale, and since I know most of the flavor profiles of these teas separately, I was excited to see what happened when they blended together.Followed the steep parameters recommended by Stacy, 3 tsp. leaf to 500 ml. water in the Breville.This brews up a lighter brown color than I usually expect for a breakfast tea. It’s very smooth and doesn’t need any additives, either, which makes it seem even less of a breakfast tea to me.Interesting…I think this tea has the lighter texture and mouthfeel of the Darjeeling, while maintaining the chocolate/malt/earthiness of the assam and keemun. It’s kind of throwing me for a loop, actually, that it has such a rich flavor without as much of a body to it.I will say that I went into this very hesitantly knowing the Keemun was in this blend – I was leery of the smoke. This Keemun is really not smoky at all (phew!) and that was the biggest thing I was worried about so this makes me very happy. I do think its more of an afternoon tea than a breakfast tea, and I also think the chocolate/raisin notes come out a LOT more as the tea itself cools.Pretty good, but not my absolute favorite blend from Butiki. Still, it was great to try it!', 'Another great tea from <strong>ifjuly</strong>. This is a great black blend. I think it’s well balanced, and stands up to the random steep parameters that I’m putting it through at work today. I don’t know if bold is the right word, it has a ton of flavor, but they aren’t in your face. It’s just nice and smooth, comforting. There are some leaves in here that are really green, that seems odd to me, but whatever it is – it works. Thanks ifjuly this is a really nice tea.', 'Sipdown! Bringing me down to 137….not that it’s going to help much since holy crap I bought 21 teas while here….guess no buying in May unless I can have a really productive Sunday. Heh. I know there are a we few sipdown teas waiting for me at home, but I’m not sure it’ll be enough.This tea will be on me reorder list for sure. It is a delicious, delicious black tea that has made. My Vancouver mornings even more wonderful…. It has a strength to it while not being overly in my face….and the flavours out of thinks one make me sit up and take note with every sip. I never expect it to be nearly as yummy as it is every time I take a sip lol.', '5/5, the best “evokes the traditional versions but betterx10000” breakfast blend ever and one of the best teas I’ve had, periodOhhhh this is so goooood. It’s so beautiful for a breakfast blend—long, gorgeous leaves of different shades of silvery green, brown, and black—such a far cry from the CTC boxed stuff one associates with them growing up as to be comical. Smells great dry too. And then steeped it looks, smells, and tastes purrrrrfect, bold with deep rich bready and earthy and even slight chocolate-y flavor, unbelievably smooth and satisfying. It’s so easy to drink, but so deep down rich and satisfying and complex too (the earthy mushroom note in particular sets this apart—might sound weird but it’s delicious). There’s a sweetness and smoothness that rounds out the bold malty assam, and the darjeeling qualities I love float lightly but ever present like a specter, just right. A tea I would use to convince a coffee drinker that tea is just as good, no better, first thing in the morning (and all throughout rest of the day!). The flavor strongly lasts for an impressively long time in the mouth too; I’ve been sitting here just basking in the yummy earthy glow lingering on my palate for like half an hour now.This is the best “straight” tasting (nothing but tea leaves) breakfast blend I’ve ever had, no question. So delicious. Will definitely have to order more, a lot more.', 'thanks <strong>Terri</strong> for a sample of this tea! I’m always excited to try darjeeling blends and this just sounded super tasty and appealing.This is a mellow tea with some nice floral aromas. I am not picking up on any keemun in here but the darjeeling is lending a bright and fruity note while the assam is malty and a bit winey. In contrast to the tea I had this morning, this is an easy one to sip on plain but I bet it would also take (soy) milk very well. I don’t think it needs sugar at all.Even though Stacy describes this as a breakfast blend, it’s something I would probably drink in the afternoon.

Not a trace of bitterness (or astringency), even when over steeped (oops! second cup was 7 minutes). The scent of Manuka Honey is very fitting for a NZ Breakfast.

I plan on writing more detailed cup by cup notes on this one as soon as I get more since this review is based on just my sample size portion of it,I need more so that I can toy with different steep times and temps and such,I don’t do cup by cup reviews really but this tea to me is worthy of such a review.

This tea makes you realize how important the smell is to the taste of the tea: I usually drink tea from a thermos, which basically eliminates the smell. Without the smell, you taste smooth cocoa, and a bit malt and honey, butterscotch. Opening the lid, however, reveals the raisins and apple pie scent on the nose, rather a sweet finish. The tea is quite soft and smooth, makes me think of grandmother’s milk-and-honey.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Butterscotch, Honey, Malt, Raisins, Red Apple\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'This tea is a very smooth, bright, and consistently fruity tea, and reminds me of summer garden parties.The leaf looks like a medium to dark roast rolled oolong with mostly chocolate to slightly darker coloured leaves and a raisiny and slightly grainy scent dusted with icing sugar and cocoa.The steeped tea colour is a bright red tone tinged with gold and the fragrance is very fruity.I’ve steeped this tea using both shorter steeps and the recommended longer steeps and found similar flavour profiles both ways.This tea has a wonderful sunwarmed strawberry note I’ve found in some Taiwanese Assam’s combined with peach in the early steeps. This is dusted with icing sugar with caramel underneath. I also found notes of light cocoa, pistachio, and malt. These notes were consistent through all my steeps ( 3 min, 3 min, 4 min/ 1 tsp/ 95°C). In my gongfu session there was a tabacco note which I didn’t find in the western steep. I also found notes of cream, cotton flower ( that only appeared when hot and then quickly dissipated) and a mineral note in the last steep. The aftertaste is very sweet with notes of fruit and sugar. The tea is very smooth, with a mild to medium body, and a good dose of caffeine. The caffeine combined with the fruity notes of the tea leave the impression of a very bright tea.

Thanks for sharing TB!', 'This is one of the many teas I scored in Rachel’s sale (whenever I say Rachel, you can assume I mean iHeartTeas since I’m pretty sure I haven’t actually swapped teas with the other Rachel with the actual username Rachel!) That was an awesome sale and I appreciate it — thanks, Rachel! This one sounded amazing. And it is! The leaves are very wirey and equal parts gold and black. I’m glad they don’t actually look like monkey paws, since that doesn’t sound very appetizing anyway. After a four minute steep it’s a sweet, slightly malty, slightly chocolatey flavor. Exactly how I love my teas. The second steep is also nice. Pretty darn good. Not as good as the best tea ever I had the other day, Butiki’s lion assam. But that is to be expected. I promise I won’t try to compare every tea with Butiki’s from here on out!

It was on the strength of that cup that I bought a new bag (although after the switch to the new version), and I’m only just now getting around to trying it.The dry leaf smells just like cocoa. In fact, I could have been convinced that I’d opened a tin of cocoa by mistake if I hadn’t been able to see what I was doing. It’s definitely tea, but SO chocolatey it’s almost unreal.Once brewed, it’s still amazingly chocolatey! I added a splash of milk just because, although in all honesty it didn’t really need it.

I believe that batch was a combination of Fujian Black and Dian Hong. The first sip of this… damn the FB is not there. It is way more smokey/savory without the sweet deep chocolate note that I loved from FB. I quickly went to the website to see what was replacing the FB. Xiao Zhong, yep that would explain the smokey/savory note. I like it, but I am not as in love with it as I was with the Summer 2014 version. This is missing the sweetness of the other version and it seems a tad thinner than before, but without a side by side comparison I can’t say for sure. Still a wonderful tea, just a little different.', 'Just here to confirm that I think this tea is quite delicious, and distinct enough from other blacks that it deserves recognition. Had it with my croissant this morning and it was a lovely pairing. I kind of like not having too too many teas in my cupboard at once—it really forces me to drink down what I do have, and to enjoy it while it’s still fresh. I have some more tea on the way through a friend who’s visiting her boyfriend in the states, and I think I’ll be done at least some of my stash by then.That said, I am fantasizing so, so deeply about when next I’ll be able to enjoy WP’s TGY.

The caramel apple calls to me more.From what I remember from visiting Mackinac as a child (I think this is the same island Brenden is referring to), this delightful tea does indeed recall that experience.

Last time, I poured two tea spoons, but they were far from being full. I thought that since the leaves are so stringy for this tea that they would open up bigger, but I was wrong on that front. I used a heaping half of a tablespoon, almost a full one really, and it tasted way better.Like I said in the previous review, North Winds is the best suited name for this tea. It smells exactly like the wind in Northern Michigan, even the woods here in Port Huron closer to Canada and the Lake. Wood, maple, cocoa, and campfire is what I personally smell when I take a single whiff of this. Last time I drank it, I tasted a cocoa, roasted black tea that was not that different from a Keemum. This time, with more leaves, there is so much more flavor. The taste is the same as the rustic aroma, being a pure breakfast blend having a simpler, yet more genuine quality than a usual English Breakfast. It’s almost like a less astringent, smoother version of an Irish Breakfast. I am glad that I decided to try this one again, and getting more out of it. My only criticism is the expense, as there are better teas that are near the same price on Whispering Pines website. Also, my sights are honed in on Golden Orchid when it comes back in stock, so I am anticipating what this particular tea base will be like with a vanilla accent. North Winds still needs another note to really fill the cup to its impressive potential, and vanilla might be the finishing note to crescendo it to greater heights.Pompous hyperbole aside, a lot of people would like it. Breakfast tea, southern sweet iced tea, and European black tea lovers would enjoy it. Though it’s slightly better Gonfu, a Chinese brewing method, it’s more reminiscent of a European drink to me. Newbies might require cream and sugar anyway, but it by no means tastes bad with the additives.

I’ve loved every black tea I’ve tried from Whispering Pines and this one was no exception. It has a heady scent and rich, full-bodied flavor.

I would enjoy the notes in this tea much more in something that was milder such as an oolong or green tea (though green tea with woodsy is a tricky combination). Overall it provides nice warm cups of good tasting tea.', 'This is my first Whispering Pines blended tea. It’s a very well balanced blend of two black teas from notable Chinese regions: <strong>Fujian</strong> Xiao Zhong and <strong>Yunnan</strong> Dian Hong. Instead of writing a review about my first tasting, I’ve waited until after enjoying all 4 oz. of my initial C.M. order. So this initial review is also a sipdown and is thus based on many cups of this excellent tea.I brewed it using the following Western brewing parameters:<strong>2g</strong> / 3 min / 205F / 8 oz: A little lighter-bodied for my taste.<strong>3g</strong> / 3 min / 205F / 8 oz: These parameters are how I brewed the majority of my 4 oz. stash. Amber colored. Definite Chocolate aroma that’s strong enough to be appreciated when standing at the kitchen counter! A smooth medium-bodied (but fuller-bodied than Laoshan Black) blended black tea. Flavor: chocolate, toasted rustic bread, honey, malt. There’s a definite fruity note (apricot?) with a marvelous creamy finish. Near the bottom of the now cooler cup, the malty flavor is a more pronounced and there is a cocoa aftertaste.5-min. resteep: Still enjoyable but lighter-bodied than the original steep with a similar flavor profile. However, the chocolate is not as pronounced and the creamy finish is diminished. Some of the twice-brewed leaves are now fully open.8-min. resteep: Light-amber color with minimal aroma. Light-bodied. I let it steep another two minutes.10-min. resteep: Light to medium-amber with minimal aroma. Light to medium-bodied with a similar flavor profile to the 1st resteep. This cup is enjoyable but definitely not as much as the original steep. The 3x-brewed leaves are now fully open.3g / <strong>5 min</strong> / 205F / 8 oz: More full-bodied and very enjoyable. My cup was empty before I knew it. However, with a 5-min. steep, the malty flavor overwhelms the subtle fruity nuances, thus they’re not as apparent. There is a definite unsweetened cocoa aftertaste.5-min. resteep: Light-bodied.10-min. resteep: Light to medium-bodied. With a 5-min first steep, there is not too much left for a resteep.<strong>2.6g</strong> (All the N.W. that was left!) / <strong>5 min</strong> / 205F / 8 oz: Full-bodied and very enjoyable with a marvelous creamy finish to the sip. None of the flavors were overshadowed by a dominant flavor. My cup was empty before I knew it! I wish I had discovered these parameters sooner. To my taste buds, this is the full-bodied version of <strong>3g</strong> / <strong>3 min</strong>. There’s a less pronounced unsweetened cocoa aftertaste that persists on the tongue. There was zero bitterness or astringency. The once brewed leaves were now fully open.I especially enjoy teas with a natural rich chocolate flavor as opposed to natural unsweetened cocoa profile. Given my preferences, my two favorite Western brewing parameters to date were:  -\\t<strong>3g</strong> / <strong>3 min</strong> / 205F / 8 oz.: Fuller-bodied than 2g and the fruity note (apricot?) was more apparent. -\\t<strong>2.6g</strong> / <strong>5 min</strong> / 205F / 8 oz.: Full-bodied with a less obvious cocoa aftertaste.<strong>Impression</strong>: An excellent unflavored blended Chinese black tea especially for those who enjoy a wonderful chocolate aroma and flavor with a cocoa aftertaste.

The taste is just what you’d expect from that too, a very welcoming combination of chocolate, malt, and nutty notes, and plus there’s that full-bodied, bready richness from the dian hong. The finish is clear and sweet, and reminiscent of apricot. It’s a wonderfully cozy tea for breakfast or any other time of day!Brendan’s inspiration behind this tea is also great to read.

Thanks go to <strong>Nicole</strong> for sending me samples of several of their teas. I chose this one to try first because the leaves are so beautiful, like soft golden pine needles. They’re fuzzy and completely gold in color. The smell is all honey, with just a little malt and sweet fruit. I did a 3 minute steep.The aroma is full of honey as well, with that same malt and a sweet fruitiness that I would describe as golden raisin. But interestingly, the first thing I taste when sipping this is fresh, bright cucumber. Cucumber? In a black tea? But there it is. Alongside malt and a light honeyed fruitiness. I just kept sipping to make sure I wasn’t crazy, and then I asked my boyfriend who agreed that he tasted cucumber. Success! As I let it cool further, the cucumber transformed slightly into honeydew melon, similar but sweeter. The aftertaste is surprisingly floral with a touch of stonefruit.This is definitely a different flavor profile than any other Yunnan teas I’ve tried so far, and I enjoyed it. Honeydew is one of my favorite flavors and even though it’s odd for a black tea, I thought it worked really well to lighten this tea and add freshness.

As it cools the pastry and malt tones become more apparent.The last two steeps (3 &amp; 4 min) had increasing floral notes, as well as artichoke mixed with dark honey all mixed in with the fading previously discovered notes.All together the pastry notes were really delicious in this tea and I would like to try it western style.

I’m fairly certain this will be another one that can take a couple goes.The liquor is a deep brown with reddish tinge and has a wonderful chocolate aroma, much like the bakers chocolate my Mum uses for some of my favourite chocolate dipped cookies. Now I really want some of those cookies, I bet they’d be AMAZING with this tea…First sips are strong chocolate flavour, rich dark bakers chocolate. At the same time though, it’s definitely tea. I really like it…odd since I always thought I hated the flavour of chocolate in tea. This is a good mix of a good black tea and my grandmother’s beloved cocoa. I don’t get a sweet chocolate taste at all, but at the same time there is a lingering sweetness in my mouth. This only confirms and continues my general adoration for black teas…Especially bold ones.Question for you steepsterites: How does this compare to Upton Tea’s Golden Monkey? The beau and I are really interested in putting that one in our imminent order, but I don’t really know what to anticipate, and since it is one of the pricier ones in my very large order, I’m a little hesitant. I understand that Upton’s Golden Monkey isn’t really meant to be so cocoa as this, and that’s great by me, but I have it in my head that the Golden creatures must be at least a little similar.. : )', 'Gave this a try today at Harney SoHo.

I should note that this tea is flavored with actual beans, which gives it a nice smoothness versus a typical “flavored” tea using extract or other processed flavoring.A second steeping holds up well, but I find that I need to about double the concentration to maintain the same strength as a first steeping. (In other words, I use half as much water in the second steeping.)Overall, a superb black tea! It works well as a morning wake-up or an after-dinner dessert companion. This is going on my must-buy list. I don’t usually enjoy “flavored” teas, but this one is done very well. If you prefer “straight” black tea like me, and you’re looking for something with a fuller flavor profile, don’t hesitate to pick this up!I tried this side by side with Whispering Pines’s Golden Orchid. If you’re wondering, this tea uses Tahitian vanilla beans, while Golden Orchid uses Madagascar beans. I think the difference between the two is that Ambrosia has a more pronounced vanilla flavor. Other than that, they are identical in my opinion, so their reviews will be very similar. Whether Ambrosia is worth the additional price over Golden Orchid depends on how much you like a stronger vanilla flavor. I give both the same rating.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Cocoa, Vanilla\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Today i’m packing my knitting stuff, my daily use stuff and my clothes.

I like it better than the Honey Black tea made by the same company. A little bit more complex.', 'Queued post, written July 19th 2014Here is the second of the three teas that Green Terrace Teas shared with me in exchange for reviews. This one I shared with Husband, so I’ve used almost the entire sample. There’s a bit left, and I’m a little concerned about whether it would have been better to use the whole thing. I think it’s only enough for half of one of my one-cup pots. Oh well. I’m sure I can burn that particular bridge when I cross it.In an effort to not waste any, I poured the entire pot into two mugs. In other words I did something that I haven’t actually done in a good while. I poured an Ang. Hurray surface tension. And saucers.Given how strong the honey black was, I thought this was probably the same story. Other people’s posts only confirmed this, so I decided it must be a suitable choice for the first tea of the day. My nose now tells me I was correct.I can smell a lot of things in here. It strikes me as quite a complicated aroma. There is raisin and something dairy-y right at first. I mean, it doesn’t <em>smell</em> like dairy, but rather like there might have been dairy added to it. Milk or cream, pick your preference (mine is neither, or if anything, milk). Next layer has grain and wood in it, reminding me strongly of all my favourite Chinese blacks, and then finally I feel like I’m catching a small whiff of something cocoa-y and a bit tart, like fruit that isn’t ripe yet. This last layer, though, I’m not certain if it’s really there or if I’m looking too hard. Either way, there is a LOT going on here.First note I find in the flavour is wood. If you remember my post about the honey black I tried to describe the look of the wood it reminded me of, but I didn’t know what sort of tree made wood that looks like that. I still don’t know anything about that, but this wood note is the same kind of wood. This is the primary note at the first sip.If I slurp when I drink, I also get that dairy-y feeling a bit and at the back of my throat a feeling like the one cocoa notes usually give me. I don’t actually <em>taste</em> cocoa, so that fits well with how uncertain I was about it in the aroma.As I drink, a grain note becomes more and more apparent. It’s even a little bit smoky, reminding me of keemun. That’s one of my favourite things, so this makes me happy.The raisins and the unripe fruit show up a little later. This is one of those teas that you shouldn’t drink quickly because it keeps evolving in the cup as it cools. It has already changed this much and I’m only a centimeter down in the cup. The vast majority of the tea is yet to be drunk. This is going to be a very long post if this keeps up. Lots of teas do this, actually, to a smaller or larger degree. That’s why I don’t like those ‘keep warm’ things with tea-candles under the pot. It messes with this process and keeps the tea warm in an uneven way. A thick cork mat under the pot and a thick cozy over it suits me much better. Far less effective, yes, but also less intrusive.Having cooled a little more, the tea has now become an explosion of honey. Such a very thick honey note, it even more honey-y than the honey black and I thought that was pretty honey-y. The notes of grain and raisins are pretty much gone at this point, and the wood note has gone from a front seat position to being bundled into the boot. I still have the dairy-y feeling though. I think it might be the honey note that makes it feel a bit thickened. From this point on, it seems the flavour has settled, and I’m not noticing any more big changes, apart from the very last bottom sip which was all cocoa all the way.Others are also talking about peaches and other stone-fruits, but try as I might I just can’t find any of that in here. I suppose I did have the bit of unripe fruit, but I feel that note has passed now.I enjoyed this <em>very</em> much indeed. It has all the characteristics that I love in my black tea. It’s complicated, interesting and life-giving.', 'Miss <strong>mj</strong> was nice enough to send me a sample of this tea in our swap! I felt oh-so left out when I didn’t choose it as one of my free samples from Green Terrace, as it seemed to be everyone’s favorite. Doh! So hooray, now I get the chance to try it! I was planning on ordering a sample soon, but they seem to have done away with their samples sizes, which makes me sad. The leaves have that “creepy tree branch” look about them, they’re very dark and thin and twisty. I think my sample may have been contaminated a bit by the sample of Crio Bru’s Cavalla that <strong>mj</strong> also sent, because it smells super chocolately! Like, on a Golden Orchid level of chocolately. No that I’m complaining, it smells delicious! :POnce brewed, the tea smells like heavenly sweet potatoes with brown sugar and cinnamon over the top. Om nom nom. Mm, that sweet potato goodness carries over to the taste as well, and so do the caramelized brown sugar and cinnamon notes. I also get some dark chewy bread, which goes well with the sweet potato. There’s a little touch of dried fruit flavor as well, more of a suggestion than anything, and not specific enough for me to call it by name. Lastly, near the end, a light floral note starts to pop up and say “hello”. It’s inoffensive, not soapy or heady, more of a light ethereal floral taste that just serves to lighten up the whole thing.

And instead of using my Keurig to dispense the hot water like I typically do, I used Watson (Watson is the name I’ve given to our Culligan water cooler, that has both a hot and cold water tap—we named him Watson after the computerized jeopardy contestant! /nerd). Anyway, from my understanding, the water dispensed from Watson is around 107 degrees F, while the Keurig website says that the Keurig dispenses water that’s 192 degrees f, so that’s definitely a noticeable difference. The thing is, however, that I never never successfully brewed a cup of satisfactory tea using Watson, and it seems odd to me that a temperature of about 207 (ETA—sorry, I originally wrote 107, which explains the general wtfness in the comments below, but it really was 207) would be too hot for absolutely every tea (especially since I drink mostly blacks, which are reputed to almost always take extremely hot water). As for the water I use, the Keurig takes filtered water through my brida filter, and Watson uses Culligan’s water—both are filtered, but are provided by different companies, so perhaps that has to do with it. But last night’s tea tasted bitter and horrible, just horrible. No vanilla cream notes to speak of—only an amped up bitter bergamot note that was bitter and gross.But this has me terrified to ever get myself a variable temp kettle, because what if the Keurig is the only acceptable source for hot water for me in this universe? this is actually really upsetting to me! Because i so badly want the Bonavida goose-neck one liter variable temp kettle, but like, if I drop 100 dollars on it but it makes all my tea taste like bile, then…then…then what?!?!?!?!!?Please comfort me.', '<strong>First, a story:</strong>I had gone out with friends to breakfast last week and ordered hot tea (earl grey – I don’t know the brand) and was surprised, in a good way, when they brought it out to me loose in the equivalent of a Perfect Tea Maker from Teavana. Not as surprised as the other girls, though – they had never seen one before. They stared at the steeper and their eyes got even bigger and all conversation stopped when I put it on top of my cup to let it drain.“I’ve never seen that before.” One of them said. “Where’s the tea bag?” was another question. There was much turning over of the plastic steeper to see how it worked. Then the waiter came by and refilled it to let it resteep. All of their minds, collectively, were blown. All for a cup of pretty mediocre Earl Grey.<strong>Okay, digressing to actual review now:</strong>When the girls at the breakfast asked how I liked the tea I shrugged my shoulders and thought of Smooth Earl from Compass Teas before telling them I prefer it with vanilla (tea snob that I am). That was before I met this guy though.A sure sign of a good tea to me is one that I can’t stop thinking about or want to have again soon after I’ve had it. For the sake of having a lot of other teas to drink I avoided coming back to this one right away, but it has been in the back of my mind.So yesterday to celebrate having almost a week off from work I made a huge mug of this and savored that thick vanilla scent and taste. So lovely. I wish when I’d been at the breakfast last week I’d been able to show everyone this Earl Grey Cream. This is what amazing tea is.A lot of you already know that, judging by the other tasting notes here, but really. Its finding teas like this that you wouldn’t have known about otherwise that makes the whole tea habit so much fun. For me it is, anyway….', 'Oh man. The smell coming out of the bag reminds me of orange slice candy. Brewed the aroma gives off this root beer – grape soda vibe. This is an Earl Grey Crème using French vanilla.If you love French vanilla this is going to please you. The description on the sample says, this is ‘estate black tea hand blended with fragrant oil of bergamot and a hint of French vanilla.’ Now I think their idea of hint and mine are a bit different. When the cup is hot this tastes highly of French vanilla. It isn’t until the cup cools that the bergamot and black tea can be more easily separated out in the sip. After you figure out the differences you become aware that you were tasting them all along. The aftertaste has a bit of a licorice twang to it that I liked.The second cup is a little different. The aroma off the cup is black tea. The taste is a much more balanced blend of all the flavors. The aftertaste leaves a lot more black tea on your breath. This is an excellent cup.', 'Took along to do errands this morning. It’s relatively light on the bergamot; either that or the warmth of the vanilla is muting that brightness. Whatever it is, this is a nice intro to Earls if you’re afraid of that part. It’s still definitely there, with that wonderful heady Earl fragrance that gets me every time—I opened up my tumbler in the car and my husband went “Mmmm that smells good, fresh and orange-y!”—but the body and flavor are lighter than most I’ve tried. Yet it doesn’t feel wimpy or lacking. A nice “don’t think too much about it” Earl for busy days you need to be soothed, not knocked over the head with strong zesty elements.', 'The Tea Merchant! You had me at the old timey wax seal on the paper around the tea envelopes! I discovered a couple weeks ago that I love love love creamy earl greys when I thought I wouldn’t like them at all. Now I want to try any and all creme earl grey and I was happy to try some samples from The Tea Merchant. This is GOOD stuff. The french vanilla, bergamot and black tea offers a triple threat of perfection. They work so so well together. The black tea has the perfect amount of flavor to showcase the bergamot and creme. It doesn’t get better than that except for the gorgeousness of the cornflowers. The second cup was just as delicious as the first. The best of the four creme earl greys I’ve had in the last few weeks.

I will DEFINITELY be ordering this when I run out of all my creme earl greys!', 'I will admit that I have never been able to tell the difference between French vanilla and regular old vanilla. It has always seemed to me that “French vanilla” taste can be achieved by using more regular old vanilla. I know it is supposed to be creamier when used in ice cream due to the egg base. Not sure how creamy is achieved when there is nothing but vanilla.But, I will say that regardless of kind of vanilla, this smells and tastes very strongly of it. :) A nice creamy vanilla that mellows the bergamot. A good, strong black tea base that complements the other flavors well.I have spent far too much time in the kitchen over the last couple of days preparing for my Christmas open house that was last night. So when I had to run out to finish up a bit of shopping today, I grabbed a package of Candy Cane Oreos. I wanted some cookies this afternoon but I didn’t want to take the time to bake again.

Insipred by Tucker Lake, I’ve never been there But I can totally get why a Lake would be the inspiration for this Tea because really My very first thought on my first sip was the thought of feeling a nearby Lake.', '<b>The Inspiration</b> Tucker Lake is an inland lake in Glen Arbor, Michigan. In the summertime, a thin layer of fog forms around the lake during the night. Each sunrise brings a light breeze to the lake, pushing the fog northward. If you row out to just the right spot and wait for the sunrise, the breeze pushes the fog right into your canoe. There is a freshness to this fog that defies all explanation. Through the trees to the south of the lake and over Dunns Farm Road, the essence of this place becomes captured in the fog. The journey begins at a small dock across the road at Fisher Lake where the rustic scent of old wooden boats and crystal clear water billows into the fog. Warm and inviting, the fog pushes through the narrow stream connecting the lakes, rolling over summer trilliums and whispering through the pine trees, becoming as sweet and warm as everything it touches. When the sun rises, the fog warms, energizes, and just before disappearing, it reaches your canoe. The last breath of fog is vanilla-sweet and saffron-warm with an energy I can not even begin to describe. As the sun rises above the trees and the bald eagles soar the skies above, you wonder why you’d ever leave.Port was inspired by this unexplainable scent and moment in time. I wanted to create the best blend I could, something to match one of my most beautiful memories. The base of this tea is a wild-picked black tea from Dehong, China, carrying intensely complex notes of sugarcane, eucalyptus, and barley over a deep rustic body. I tried all of our usual herbs, spices, and flowers, but nothing came close to matching the freshness of this memory, so I took the plunge and used the two ingredients that I knew would bring me back to Tucker Lake – organic madagasgar vanilla beans and spanish saffron. The result was a more perfect incarnation than I could have ever imagined. Port has the most beautiful vanilla notes, a rustic base tea, perfect saffron warmth, and is rounded out with the evergreen sweetness of roasted red cedar tips.I can proudly say that this is my greatest achievement!<b>Notes</b> Vanilla Saffron Evergreen Cedar Sugarcane Eucalyptus Barley Summer<b>How to brew the perfect cup:</b> Steep 1 tablespoon of leaves in 8 ounces of 200ºF water for 2 minutes.2nd infusion: 3 minutes 3rd infusion: 4 minutes 4th infusion: 6 minutes 5th infusion: 8 minutes 6th infusion: 10 minutes<b>Ingredients</b> Black Tea Roasted Red Cedar Tips Organic Madagasgar Vanilla Beans Spanish Saffron<b>Caffeine Content</b> High<a href=\"http://whisperingpinestea.com/port.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://whisperingpinestea.com/port.html</a>', 'I really like this tea. It’s earthy and woodsy and the vanilla goes with it perfectly. As with each of the Whispering Pines teas I’ve tried, it’s truly unique- and delicious!', 'Thank you <strong>blodeuyn</strong> for this perfect sample!I heard about Port from various tea friends and was intrigued by the name. I then saw that the company had named this its “greatest achievement”, so I knew I needed it in my life, hahah. Luckily, a tea friend came to my rescue, again, and I was able to indulge in this discovery.This is truly the most unique blend I’ve ever had. I peer through my package at the strange assortment of leaves. I can spot long ceder with creeping black tendrils surrounding it. Then, scattered about this smokey mixture are small wisps of fiery saffron. I opened my small pouch to inhale. I am tantalized with an array of scents. It reminds me of this old italian shoppe my father used to take me to when I was younger. I remember in the back room there were large wooden casks filled with wine and various liquor. The room had an enticing erie scent. I used to just stand back there to inhale the soft wooden aroma. I remember there being a light leather scent in the background. I class this aroma as pure ethnic. I am already flooded with memories and can’t wait to brew. I pour my steaming spring water over these dry leaves and it hit with a slight sizzle. I can describe the scent as if one of the casks in the back room of that italian shoppe had burst open. My tea room was flooded with a deep cedar smell covered by brandy and wine. It had a slight undertone of a robust vanilla. The liquor was a golden brown with a tinge of crimson. I took a sip of this aromatic beverage and was greeted with a smooth wood tone and hearty vanilla. It calmed my tongue and left me with an eucalyptus feel. I drank heartly and whisked my mind away back to that italian shoppe. My favorite attribute of good tea is its ability to let you travel. I enjoy being able to travel across the globe without even leaving my tea room. I’m not sure if others do this, but I do. This is another superb blend by this company! I’m very happy I was able to experience it.<a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/0VPQfTTGRS/?taken-by=haveteawilltravel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://instagram.com/p/0VPQfTTGRS/?taken-by=haveteawilltravel</a>\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Brandy, Cedar, Leather, Smooth, Vanilla\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'I’m finally trying out my sample (from Lindsay, I think?), and wow am I glad I did. This is such a unique tea.The dry leaf smells strongly of sweet, fruity alcohol. I’m thinking brandy, a tawny port or some kind of liqueur.Steeped, the tea soup has the same strong, alcohol fragrance to it, which carries through to the palate. In addition, there are also notes of Chinese medicine, dates, prunes, and lou han gou fruit.This is definitely a rich and luxurious cup of tea. The ingredients combine in such an interesting way, that I don’t actually identify any of them in the flavour.I don’t think I’d drink this often, but for a special treat, this is amazing.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Alcohol, Brandy, Dates, Herbaceous, Plums, Red Wine, Sweet\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'This is glorious. And little did I know that I would need some gloriousness in my day. It is one of the most delicious cups I have ever had. It was unexpected, for sure. It is very saffron-y, both dry and steeped. I also had no idea how much I would love the cedar scent and flavor that gave an almost boozey aspect. I also really tasted the vanilla in this one, particularly in the second steep when the saffron and cedar chilled out a bit. So great. SO so great. Now I am paranoid of running out. Eep.Storytime: Online Dating Blows I just had a terrible phone call, talking to a guy I met here on OkCupid. A guy I’ve been talking to via text and email literally nonstop for days. I request a phone call as the next step. He was normal and able to interact via email, and text. On the phone he was uncomfortable and stiff with overtones of superjerk. Pretty much said all teachers whine too much about how their job is hard when it really is such a cushy job they have no right to complain about anything. And while I agree there are many perks (summers and holidays off, etc), cushy is not the word I would use to describe my future profession (that he knew I was going into).Even after that I was nice. I asked other questions. Every answer he gave was “I don’t know” followed by dead silence because I literally didn’t know how to respond, until he finally qualified his answers. Eventually I just asked why he was having so much trouble talking to me when he had no problem using text. He basically said he didn’t know what I wanted him to say, unable to grasp that if he would say it over text, he should say it with his actual voice. No more, no less. So I suggested we call it a night.I have never, ever, in my whole life been in a situation with so much social failure with interaction. Nobody here knows me in person but if they did, they would know I am incredibly socially adept with conversation. Even if they are very awkward people. Ask about enough stuff and eventually you HAVE to hit on a topic that triggers an interest or a memory that could lead to a conversation. But what do you do about a man who, when asked what two pizza toppings he would pick if he could only have two his whole life, says cheese because he doesn’t need complicated pizza? TOPPINGS ARE NOT A COMPLICATION. I can’t even handle it. He didn’t seem stupid an hour ago. I don’t know what happened. Now I am feeling a bit like a dating failure. lol. And frustrated with the whole dating process.I needed good tea today.', 'Off topic: You guys, I am SO obsessed with the Hamilton Original Broadway Cast Recording right now. Ugh, go listen to it so I’ll have someone to geek out with. :)Instead of buying more Whispering Pines tea I thought I’d drink some of the stuff I already own. This is an interesting and delicious blend – I love the roasted cedar and vanilla.', 'WOW this tea is really unique! Thanks for the sample <strong>Cameron B</strong>!I’ve never tasted Cedar before. I guess that is what is giving the overall alcoholic feel to the tea. It does remind me of bourbon or scotch or something! There’s a sweetness to it, and a woodiness and creaminess. Very interesting. It is dark and somewhat rich. I like it but this would not be an everyday drinking tea for me!', 'Thanks so much to <strong>Dexter</strong> for sending me samples of these pricey Whispering Pines teas! The leaves of this one are rather broken, but I think that’s mostly because it came from the bottom of the package. I can see the cedar leaves and a few scant saffron fragments mixed in. Dry scent is earthy, woody, and reminds me of scotch.This tea has a very manly aroma. It’s a mixture of woody and leather with a touch of vanilla, and makes me think of a study with a vintage wooden desk and leather-bound books. Hmm, this one is actually quite interesting. It tastes much as I would expect it to from the aroma – there’s a strong woody flavor and roasty note. It tastes almost exactly like high-quality scotch to me (I don’t drink, but my boyfriend loves scotch so I’ve tasted his on multiple occasions). I can taste a hint of menthol at the end of the sip.

I tasted the vanilla and probably the saffron, both strong, both powerful, competing. As I continued to steep this the vanilla got slowly stronger. By the fifth steeping the vanilla was dominate. The other flavors moved to the back burner. This was a really good tea. I would probably rate this tea lower if I had only steeped it once. This is definitely a tea for multiple steepings.I steeped this five times in a 8oz YIxing teapot. I used 2 tsp leaf and boiling water. I steeped it for 2 min, 2.5 min, 3 min, 4 min, and 5 min.

I thought that today would not take as long – daughter was testing for college entrance. Apparently she did well as she was in there for almost three hours. The test is designed so that if you do not do so well you don’t “progress” thus the test is shorter. Anyway … I was without tea for what seemed like a lifetime.  It is so good to be home having this wonderful delicious amazing tea.  Previous notes on this one although I now know what kind of tea it really IS lol still please look at those Im too much enjoying this cup right now to express how wonderful it is.  AHHHHH TEAAAAAA SIGH', '<strong>Wombatgirl</strong> sent me this one, and I’ve been curious about it since I took it out of the box. Tangerine blossoms. That sounds really appealing to me, so I didn’t really want to use it because then I wouldn’t have it anymore and the joy of expectation would be gone as well. I admit the latter is probably the biggest problem.There’s a floral smell of the blossoms, slightly perfume-y and sweet with a surprisingly caramel-y middle. I seriously wasn’t expecting that! Nevertheless, there it is. Unmistakably caramel and honey, with citrus-y tangerine aromas surrounding it. This stuff’s aroma blows my mind! Or… nose, rather. Very very nice!Oh my word! Did I just take a sip of tea or did I bite a tangerine? This is very tangerine-y in a very natural way. Not a hint of synthetic perfumeiness to be found here. It’s citrus-y and sweet, sugared even. Although there’s a lot of caramel in the aroma, it’s not really in the flavour. It’s more of a mild not too refined sugar here.So there’s a lot of flavour added here, but it still manages to be a rather delicate little thing. This is a tea that requires a quiet moment of relaxation. You can’t just chug it while doing all sorts of other stuff. Well, you can, but it would be a crying shame.It’s no secret that I’ve been rather pleased with the Russian blends from Kusmi (with one notable exception), and how they all had some varying amounts of citrus fruit in them. But they don’t really measure up to this. This tastes like what Kusmi <em>tried</em> to achieve.This tea is an absolute beauty. Please, Steepsterite, if you like citrus fruits and something sweet but not cloying, do yourself a favour and try this one.', 'This tea is amazing. I’m just going to start with that.This has been on my “to try” list for it seems like forever. The idea of a lightly flavored floral-citrus blend, and the fact that it is unique in being a red (i.e., black) tea created from white tea leaves, were very appealing to me. Fortunately <strong>Azzrian</strong> was kind enough to send me a sample, and so my wishes have been fulfilled. And this one, lucky for me, lives up to my expectations.First of all, it smells wonderful, like tangerines with a light floral note. Like orange blossom water with the addition of a brightish black tea base underneath. Flavor-wise, definite yum. It’s such a light and bright black tea, but still distinctively a black tea. The flavoring is present but light and natural. This seems like a scented tea, like the tea was dried with tangerine blossoms (like how jasmine greens are made), and maybe it was. In any case, I am very much enjoying this cup and this will definitely go on my “to order (once I gain control of my stash)” list.', 'Wow. I’m loving this tea!It’s very aromatic, and very flavorful. Have you ever tried orange flower water in anything? Did you like it? If so, you’ll LOVE this. Since it uses tangerine blossoms rather than orange blossoms, it’s a slightly sweeter taste, but it’s got that flavor from the blossoms that doesn’t delve into sour or bitter like using orange peel in tea can. When used too much, orange flower water can move towards perfumy, but while this tea does have an aromatic quality (and leaves the ghosts of tangerine blossoms in your mouth) it’s not too heavy; nor does it taste like you’re chugging your grandmother’s perfume.It’s also got an aroma and aftertaste of boiling sugar. Not that the brew is particularly sweet, but there’s an aroma when you’re making candy and this also has it. Warm and sweet, (and possibly sugar cane-y, but I haven’t gotten the opportunity to sniff many sugar canes, so I may be wrong on that…)My delight in this tea is also surprising as it’s fairly delicate. I’m a bold flavor girl, and this is not bold, but oy! It’s yummy. If it can hold up to multiple steeps, I’ll be in heaven.', 'This tea perplexes me. In reading the bit of information on the sample package, it would be easy to think that this is a white tea, but it is not. I brewed it according to package directions, using boiling water that has cooled for 1 minute, and then steeping for 2 minutes.The flavor is excellent. The tangerine is strong here, but there is a nice balance between tea and fruit. It tastes sweet, juicy and citrus-y but not overwhelming. I like this very much.', 'This is so, so, so exactly what I needed today. I’m pretty sure I’m coming around with my bi-yearly bout of bronchitis and needed an amazing cup as a pick me up. This filled that spot perfectly.Shang got put on my radar by the last tea box, with the sample of Jasmine White Classic that was in there, but this really cements my need to make a purchase once my cupboard is under better control.I’m stunned by how flavorful this is while still feeling dainty and delicate. The tangerine blossom adds a sweet floral quality, and leaves ghosts of juicy tangerines dancing on your tongue. The floral quailty is immersive and fragrant, but not overwhelming soapy or perfumey. Like I’ve seen in a couple other reviews, this one very much seems scented (dried with the blossoms, like some jasmine tea), but whatever it is, it absolutely works. The base also has it’s own natural sugar sweetness, and is smooth.What a luxurious, stunning cup.Thank you very, very much <strong>TeaTiff</strong>!', 'wow, this is delicious. It says it’s a fermented white tea so what does that mean, no wonder people are confused because all black tea is fermented as far as I know. I think it means this is a plant that is normally used for white tea only but here it’s been fermented?Anyhoo, this tea is actually a light red. I steeped mine at around 180 F for two minutes and I found it to be very delicious – definitely light bodied but very full and sweet in the aftertaste, not a trace of bitterness to be found. The tangerine is present but not overpowering here. I would for sure order this again, it’s really a treat and nothing like I’ve experienced so far in my tea drinking journey. I have been very impressed with all of the samples I got from Shang from their clean, sweet and delicate nature.', 'This is a white?! Two teas in two days that have shocked me in the same way. White that looks like a black, tastes like a black, and is even named a black (Tangerine Blossom Red Tea – red tea is what we consider to be black here). This is a thick, malty and slightly sweet tea with subtle floral notes – again so surprising considering the one minute steep time! I’d love to grab more of this to try it properly… if I love it this much severely underleafed, what will I think of it done right?Thanks (I think?) to <strong>TeaTiff</strong> for sharing this in the 12 Days of Christmas Swap!2 tsp in 16oz. – which according to the instructions is severely underleafed… I should have used 1/2-2 TB per 8 oz.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Fruit Tree Flowers, Malt\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Here I am starting the day with a big bang that is this tea. I feel kind of like an idiot for not having ordered more of it (what I have is just a sample from the Shang Tea sampler), but then I got an ounce of their other black (or, as they prefer to put it, red) tea, so it’s all good. Next time I am totally getting a bunch of this.BECAUSE it is sooo good and it reminds me of jasmine black tea but without the weird bitterness that can creep in sometimes with jasmine, plus there’s some orange-citrus-sweet lingering note in there. That of course is the tangerine part. Good stuff.I’m bumping the rating up a bit because 89 from before didn’t do this any justice.', 'Apparently this is on my shopping list, so I must have seen it mentioned before and wanted to try it. Huh. I had no idea so that makes it even better to have now!Definitely an interesting tea, it does not have the delicate flavor of a white tea at all, but still has some of the floral notes, thanks to the blossoms. I really liked it even better when it cooled off entirely, which of course doesn’t take long today.The sweet citrus flavor is really nice without being strongly fruity, it’s pretty amazing.

First of all, BEAUTIFUL packaging. I am in love with the small tins, they are sooo delicate! And the box is so pretty too, and it says how to brew all the teas + the ingredients on the box! Yay for ingredients, because I couldn’t actually find any on the site, and having a nut allergy, this made me a bit apprehensive lol. But I digress..onto the tea!The dry smell is soooo yummy. It has a wonderful cream scent in there. I love that the EG classic also came in this set, because I could compare the two and you can definitely smell more bergamot in the classic lol. I might have to have a cup after to compare flavors too.I steeped for 4 mins, as suggested time was 4-6 for only 6 oz of water, and I am super terrified of strong black tea, so I went with the min, although that even seemed a bit long, and also a bit more water. Oh, and I just used my brew basket, not the provided satchets, although those may come in handy at work hehe. The steeped smell is very nice, it actually is reminding me of Paris by Harneys quite a bit, must be the vanilla flavors. There is also a sweet scent underneath, similar to fruity but also like caramel? Lol, that doesn’t make sense. Well, that’s what the nose is saying today (allergies are also running rampant lol).Ohh yessss, this is really quite delicious. It is SO reminding me of Paris, but without the fruity aftertaste. This is really quite good. Darn it, I don’t want it to be super good, because then I will have to spring for an order probably at some point….haha, not for a while yet though! And with the 4 minute steep, it is not bitter nor too weak, although I might try a short steeping next time just to see if it’s even creamier than it is now. I think I like Ceylon bases in tea as well, although I am not a very hardcore black tea drinker and don’t know much about them haha, but it seems like the blends I like list Ceylon as the base. But I’m babbling (sorry, I am excited about new tea hehe) so I will stop now haha.Overall, a very nice tea. I am very pleased I finally picked some of this up, because it’s a wonderful blend of cream and bergamot with a delicious black base. +1 for Sloane Teas so far!ETA – As it cools, more of the black tea flavor comes out, but it’s still tasting pretty good. Not quite as much creaminess, well, except in the aftertaste it is still there, yay!', 'So I gave some samples of this in little window boxes to a friend last year(and the EG classic from Sloane as well), for her bday. Didn’t hear anything of it til a few weeks ago, when she told me she loved it!!  Well, her bday is coming up again so guess what I did… I bought her a tin. She actually squealed! I was happy to spread the tea love. Even if it was via the eeeevil bergamot haha.  Also, we arranged a friend’s baby shower and handed some of the window boxes out as gifts. This was yesterday. I chose this one, the rouge provence, and oolong creme. Shouldn’t be long before I get someone asking me where I bought them! :P  Oh yah, and baby shower planning is exhausting! but ohhhhh so much fun!!!', 'I had to double-check the label on the tin because this smelled very much like an earl grey when I opened it and I thought I’d mixed it up with the Earl Grey Classic in my sampler set. I’m glad to be proven wrong though because, even though there is a distinct tang of bergamot, it’s definitely the vanilla cream that dominates. The tea has such a sweet, rich flavour even though I brewed this cup plain with no milk or sweeteners. I’ll try it with a longer steep and milk next but even as is it’s an excellent blend.', 'So Heavenly Cream is just another name for Creamy Earl Grey.

I had been on the search for a tea that tasted like this for quite some time and could not believe I had finally found it.

It’s definitely a creamy one, and the bergamot isn’t too heavy. It shouts at the top of a mountain that it’s an EGC, alright.Next time I’d consider adding a little vanilla extract to make this more London Fog-like. I don’t think it’s worth paying full price for, but I’m glad I was able to snag a tin of this for 60% off after Christmas at Holt Renfrew. Unimportant, but the tins HR sells around then holidays are different than the traditional ones you see online. This one is black with HR branding on it. Both designs are great.Unrelated, but I’m back to the drawing board in regards to job-hunting. That one I started last week was really taking a toll on me with its insane early morning wake-ups. Eventually I would have had to get up even an hour earlier for their flex schedule, plus after seeing what was required for the (temporary) job, I didn’t think it would be worth it because they were also underpaying for the position. I know, bad time to let go of a job and be picky when the economy is bad but I’d sooner spend the next while looking for another one—and hopefully find another one—during the time that I would have been stuck at this one, and wouldn’t have been able to go to job interviews.My mom just got home from her doctor’s appointment devastated that she has more (high-risk) surgery scheduled in the spring, so the Bowie news don’t help matters as he has always been a favourite of hers. “My Ziggy…” as she just said.

It’s joining the Battle of the Earl Greys and there are a couple I cannot wait to try it against!The smell, the taste, and the story. They combine gorgeously in this tea and I am apparently incapable of showing any indifference to it. The name is perfect – it truly is a silky tea, with just layers after layers of nuances.

I either put too much milk or too few leaves because it was super weak and unsatisfying. Not that this is surprisingly lately. I am perpetually dissatisfied. With tea :(I realize it must sound mental when I say stuff like that, the former 5 cup a day lady not being able to stomach even a cup a day half the time, or even one per week, so I will just come right out with it…. I’m about 14 weeks preggers and the baby is probably a demon that has turned me off my beloved tea. I kid, well about the demon part. Obviously!!It’s an incredibly ironic forehead slapping twist of fate, though. I’ve stocked up on so much tea over the last few months (right up until about 2 months ago when I had the harsh realization that the smell of my flavoured teas was turning my stomach and totally repelling me)… Now I have zero urge to drink it.  Even now when I have a random cup it’s more out of a sense of obligation than an actual enjoyable experience. So sad!!! I hope it comes back six months from now!!!I’m sticking to the unflavoured or mildly flavoured teas at this point, that’s for sure!!Right now all I want to drink is chocolate milk and apple juice, two things I maybe had two-three times a year previously.', 'thank you so much Teajo for a sample of this one! There is enough here for many cups. The dry leaves are as black as they could be. I always thought cream was what made me love an earl grey. But this one is so smooth, it is almost like there is cream here (though there isn’t.) This is a very different earl grey somehow. It’s unique… I guess all earl greys are different. This one is citrusy and bright but very smooth. It kind of reminds me of Fruity Pebbles cereal (awesome, in my opinion!) The second steep reminded me of the lemon part of a firecracker popsicle (awesome again). The black tea base is an assam. I don’t think earl greys usually have an assam base.. I’m not sure. But the base here is perfect for an earl grey flavor. It doesn’t disappear behind the earl grey but it doesn’t overpower it either. I didn’t see how there was safflower or cacao in this though. But I do agree that it is silky! I really really like this one. This one tells me that earl grey creams aren’t the only earl greys I love! This is a straight earl grey I could easily buy a ton of!', 'To me, Earl Grey is the father figure of all tea. A solid dude that you can rely on at all times.Always there to support you, loving you and hugging you when you need to. Keeping things simple and comforting cause you know exactly what to expect.This Earl is a very good illustration of that. Not all Earl Greys are created equally, they often are unbalanced, bergamot kicking a little too strong.The balance on this one is perfection! The bergamot is done just right in a non bitter way, leaving plenty of room for the excellent assam base to shine through. It’s creamy without any vanilla flavouring addition.This is my go to tea of the morning when there’s no time for fuss, knowing I won’t have to compromise on the quality.Thank you Teajo for giving me a good Papa Earl to rely on :-)', 'Made this one as a cold brew. Brewed for only about 4 hours because I forgot to put it in the fridge last night, and put it in this morning, then I couldn’t wait to try it.This is <strong>BY FAR</strong> the most <strong>DELICIOUS</strong> cold brew earl grey I have tried. It is bold but smooth. The bergamot is strong but not overpowering, it has a natural sweetness. I am getting a sweet taste that I can’t quite place. I want to say it is like when you caramelize shredded coconut, like for a dessert, that sweet sticky stuff that sits on top of the coconut shavings, that is what I am tasting but without the coconut taste. There is definitely a citrous taste to it, like a spicey pink grapefruit, or the rind of a navel orange. It is all very subtle and blends well together.This was the last of my free sample that came from Teajo but I think this one is going on the shopping list.', 'Thanks for the free sample from <strong>Teajo</strong>!<strong>Not-Tea Notes</strong>It was nice to see this in my mailbox today – such a good day!In Shakespeare, we all had to prepare the same scene from Richard III. My professor announced today that we were having a surprise “callback” – he was going to pick scene partners out of a hat. We decided that the two best actors would get to pick monologues for our professor to perform for us. As far as I know, none of us have ever seen him act.I was the last Elizabeth to go, and the universe was on my side – the Richard I was put with happened to be the girl I rehearsed with most often. I won out of all the Elizabeths (and I’m not even really an actor, I just love Shakespeare SO FREAKING MUCH) and so the Richard winner and I performed the whole scene – he was someone I’d worked with too, so we already had a sort of rhythm going, and it was surprisingly different from the first time I’d done it.And now we get to see my professor do a Don Pedro monologue from Much Ado and a Hal monologue from Henry V… the latter of which he’s never performed in front of people before. Happy spring break, professor! :)<strong>Tea Notes</strong>I smelled this one, and thought “ooh, that’s strong.” I don’t have any straight Earl Greys because I’m not a huge fan of bergamot – I prefer EGCs. But I like to have one in my collection.I put two heaping teaspoons in my 20oz Amsterdam pot, boiling water, 2 min.The first cup was surprisingly light. It was a really beautiful Assam base, and it wasn’t overwhelmingly perfumey. The bergamot was supported because the tea itself is of a good quality.Later cups got stronger, perhaps because it cooled. I thought it might have been due to broken pieces left in the bottom of the pot, but there’s hardly anything there.It was smooth enough for me to drink straight. I might do milk/sugar next time, just because of personal preference, but it really is a great Earl Grey!', 'Got it yesterday and actually conducted an EGC tasting last night. Almost forgot this one coz I hadn’t logged it in my catalog yet so I rushed to steep it alongside the 5 EGCs but then i realized this was not an EGC!No matter, it tastes just as good as one. Or rather, this trumps them all in my book! Many thanks to Piccolo for the very generous sample..but I’m afraid it will not be enough for me, haha. I gotta buy more of this!Silky – perfectly describes the beautiful taste that coursed through my tastebuds and captivated me (sigh)order it here:  <a href=\"http://www.teajo.com/product_info.php?cPath=23&amp;products_id=47\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.teajo.com/product_info.php?cPath=23&amp;products_id=47</a>Thank you for offering a beautiful EG, Teajo Teas!update: 2nd steep was still ok. 3rd was not quite but then again, neither were the others. maybe it was because i left them sitting too long? i noticed that with EGs they dont taste so good when cooled and actually become bitter-ish. all of them except for one….which you shall read about in my next tasting note!', 'I almost forgot I had samples coming to me from Teajo! Thanks for the samples, folks!This is a <strong>very good</strong> Earl Grey. Very smooth. Creamy, almost like it has vanilla, though there is no overt vanilla taste. Really strong bergamot but not acidic or bitter. If you are not a bergamot fan, this is not going to be for you.Ingredients say cacao, but I taste only bergamot and cream.A really high quality Earl Grey. I’d definitely keep this in my cupboard over other Earls. Maybe it’s the Indian base – I do love Indian black teas.', 'So this is the Earl Grey! And it’s a sipdown! (Much needed too, I gotta say. My samples from Courtney came in yesterday and now I’m over 230, with a Butiki order coming in the next few weeks, and some more samples from Sil! Haha. BEST problems to have).This is a pretty decent Earl Grey. It’s really not that strong but there is a tangy astringency at the end of each sip. It’s enjoyable, but I think I prefer EGC over regular EG’s. And yes, I know I could just ADD cream, but… I’m lazy? Also I guess I’m just used to drinking it plain.'], 'Polarity': [0.3396694214876033, 0.025972393267651887, 0.11835784313725493, 0.21866709183673466, 0.08796296296296295, 0.23510416666666675, 0.26022727272727275, 0.040128205128205106, 0.15516183035714284], 'Mouthfeel': '', 'Flavor Profile': {'Spicy': 0.6666666666666666, 'Char': 0.0, 'Sweet': 0.26666666666666666, 'Nutty': 0.06666666666666667, 'Floral': 0.0, 'Herbs': 0.0, 'Vegetables': 0.0, 'Grass': 0.0, 'Wood': 0.0, 'Earth': 0.0, 'Mineral': 0.0, 'Marine': 0.0, 'Berry': 0.0, 'Citrus': 0.0, 'Tree Fruit': 0.0, 'Tropical': 0.0}}\n",

It still has that crisp, light flavor that Darjeeling is known for, and that sweet, wine-like quality.Less muscatel than is typically found in a Darjeeling, though.

As it cools, it starts to taste fruitier and reminds me of putting apricots in red wine- still dark and earthy, but with a little bit of citric brightness peaking out.', '<strong>MzPriss’ Unflavored Tea Box – Tea #5</strong> I’m sad to inform all future participants of this teabox, that the Jun Chiyabari is sadly already past it’s prime… too much traveling, I suppose. I just wanted to try a little bit to see if it was still the same flavor I remember when Single Origin mailed samples to me, and luckily was the first tea I sampled as soon as the package arrived. The flavor is still muted here, just only but not as much as the sample they sent me when I tried it again months later. This tea is the most sensitive to age that I’ve ever tried. It is the most amazing tea in the world, but it needs to me enjoyed FRESH. It’s like that flower that only blooms one day a year or something. So so sad. I really suggest everyone try a little bit of this tea as fresh as possible. The second cup at boiling was too bitter to drink. I don’t recommend boiling this one! Steep #1 // 15 min after boiling // 2-3 min Steep #2 // half mug // just boiled // 3 min', 'A very nice tea. Much like a Darjeeling, but not as thick as I think of second flushes as being. It’s very light and mildly vegetal but with a bit of the dryness of Darjeeling in the background. I’ll have to try again and pay a bit more attention to steeping time. I think I did this about 3 1/2 minutes but it could have been longer. I was also cleaning the cat water fountain and may have gotten a bit distracted… :)Thanks, James, for putting this in with my sample bag. It’s one I’d drink again. I’ll bet when I share this with my Darjeeling fan coworker, he’ll like it as well.', 'This is a pretty tea with twisted leaves in a variety of dark chocolate and copper colors as well as some silvery buds.I’ve gone through 3 steepings of this tonight which was probably a bit much but it’s a really solid tea. I probably should have took notes as I went along since I’ve been drinking it over the past four hours including all through dinner. From what I recall it was light with malty and floral notes. There’s also a bit of tannic dryness at the end.', 'As it brewed, I smelled that grapelike smell that I assume must be what Darjeeling afficionadoes call “muscatel.” However, I’m fairly new to Darjeelings and I rarely drink wine, so this is something I need to research a bit more.The brewed tea is a golden brown colour slightly darker than amber, and very clear. Although this tea was picked in the summer, it reminds me of an autumn flush Darjeeling that I used to have. My understanding is that authentic Darjeelings have a second flush that’s characterized by strong fruit flavour and a bit of sparkle. This tea, in contrast, is more muted.Full review here: <a href=\"http://booksandtea.ca/2015/07/tea-review-jun-chiyabari-second-flush-nepal-by-single-origin-teas/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://booksandtea.ca/2015/07/tea-review-jun-chiyabari-second-flush-nepal-by-single-origin-teas/</a>', 'This was my breakfast tea for the morning, and it was pretty delicious. This has a similar resemblance to an autumn flush darjeeling. The dry leaves are large twisted knots ranging from dark brown gold to a mudded green. The flavor is very similar to darjeeling as well. It carries a crisp and light tone, but it has less muscatel. There is also a strong rose flavor throughout the brew.

I don’t know much about Nepalese teas, I think I’ve had one before this, but it seems like they’re usually described as being similar to Darjeeling. The leaves certainly have that sort of look – there’s a variety of colors including some silvery tips. Dry scent is sweet and soft with hay notes.The steeped tea has a very mild and soft aroma, similar to the dry leaf. Wow, I’m quite surprised by how mild this tea is (I guess I shouldn’t be given the aroma). Perhaps I underleafed? There’s a definite grape note (not winey, just fresh grape), perhaps that’s what people mean when they say muscatel? Otherwise, I’m finding this more similar to a white tea than black. It has mild hay notes along with honey. There’s a touch of deeper, almost malty flavor that makes the whole black tea thing believable for me.

I plan to spend at least part of this day drinking samples of all of the teas <strong>Sil</strong> &amp; I shared from Taiwan Tea Crafts, in part because I haven’t drank any of them for awhile, &amp; also because TTC is having a SALE! So I need to decide if I want MOAR of any (or all) of these!This one wins the prize for the most beautiful packaging, lol. The packaging of all of these samples is absolutely beautiful, very colorful, but this one especially. Flavor-wise, this is also one of my favorites. This one &amp; #154 are very similar, with a sweet fruity taste, &amp; I have enough to drink them each one more time after today.My steeping parameter today is to use my little blue lotus porcelain teapot (roughly 4oz, same size as my yixings, &amp; they all look so nice together on the shelf). This allows me to run 3 full length steepings, but only drink about 12 oz total.

This one is definitely more bold and more “Assam” like. Still fruity and super delicious, but bolder and deeper in flavor than the premium one. That being said, I think I actually prefer the premium. I think. I’m not sure. The premium one is a bit sweeter and is really buttery. Tastes so similar to the Caramel Vanilla Assam. It’s also a bit fruitier. I love them both. The #147 is a good first morning tea. I think the other is a great second morning tea :-)', 'Sipdown, 149 (new samples acquired last night). Thanks, Sil, for this sample!This tea is totally blowing my mind. I’ve had a sample of Sun Moon Lake Black tea before, but this tea completely blows it out of the water. I guess this is also equivalent to Butiki’s PTA, and I can see some of the similarities, but this is definitely unique in my mind.It didn’t seem that exceptional at first, and I kind of started drinking it without thinking about it too much. Then holy caramel! So sweet and soooooo much like caramel! I get it in the scent too now. Fruity, yes, and I agree with cooked fruit, like a jam. But this time the fruit isn’t accompanied by whatever notes usually are in a fruity black tea that I dislike (I have a hard time describing them, but I know them when I taste them).

There was a bitterness there that i didn’t love. still not a bad cup..just not one i need to keep around.Final Count yesterday: 114', 'Made a pot of this yesterday in my new big 4-cup (I think) teapot I got at the Queen Mary Tea Emporium when I was there last week.

Compared to my Oolong drinking friends I’m almost blind to bitterness or astringency, but I had a hard time preventing this tea from hitting too hard.Got a tip that could help me tailor my steeping?

Loved this steeping!+Steepings 1-8 had a sweetness detectable by the tip of the tongue. Steeping 9 and 10 did not.+Steepings 2-9 had an intense, lingering combo of black-tea bitterness and green tea astringency that distracted me. Temps 190 and 200 made little difference in fixing the problem.+Discovery: the practiced sipping technique of a person suffering from too much attention to detail took the spotlight off the bitterness. Aerate enough and coat the tongue from tip to tail and the balance starts to come back.<b>Edit</b>Tried 5 grams instead of 7 and this made all the difference in the world. It has a tiny bit of astringency but in perfect balance with the rest of the tea. Got this idea from the TeaDB youtube channel. One of the guys will, instead of lowering temp, drop the leaf to water ratio.', 'Savoring this lovely tea this morning and now pondering the need to get some Golden Earl from Brenden.', 'I was excited to try this tea, while it tasted good, it did not live up to the hype around it. I liked it, didn’t love it.', 'Very cool looking leaf – tight little spirals of gold. I did not use a gaiwan, brewing it western style (Bad girl, Sakura!) for the 5 minutes suggested. I’m getting a bit of earthy cocoa, and wish I could detect more than a hint of honey. I’m searching for it, and it’s there, just not as apparent as I hoped for. Really enjoyable tea, though, and I’m finding it comforting, a break from my all-too-usual flavored teas. I tend to not be able to get to a second infusion in one sitting, so what I’ve been doing with the second infusion is to take the brew and chill it for iced tea later. SO GOOD. I love it iced this way, and at least I get a second brewing out of it. I have to say, I’ve been thoroughly enjoying the various WP teas I’ve been trying. I’m sticking with blacks, as that’s my preference, and I’m really pleased, overall. Good stuff.', 'this tea smells great, tastes great too. it smells of coco and malt in a compost kind of way.. not a bad thing. it tastes like it smells imo. it yeilds a nice reddish color. its not as thick as i would like in the mouthfeel. ive had this tea for a while, drank it once or twice in the past, now i review. theres a noticeable watery, slightly acidic dimention to this one. i dont remember this tea being like this in the past.. still good but maybe my temp shouldnt be 90C, idk.i just steeped it again for less time and that undernote is less pronounced. this is the third steep. i used 6g for a 130ml pot. its a good black, would probably buy again, or something similar.i like wp’s jabberwocky more though.-nycoma', 'I first had this about one year ago, and it blew me away from the start. The burst of a very vibrant, sweet-ish scent I could sit and inhale for an hour, and the combination of malty and honeyed flavors (to my taste buds – I am a fairly novice tea drinker) made this an instant favorite, and the one I choose when wanting to kill a good amount of time relaxing with a cuppa.Over the next year, I tried many other Yunnans and blacks, thinking that I might find something comparable to the Golden Snail. So far, nothing even comes close. This tea is otherworldly, smooth and so layered. Stands up to repeated steeps, too.Along with Earl Gold and Imperial Gold Buds, this tea has solidified Whispering Pines as my ultimate go-to for spectacular teas. Brenden is on to something really special, and I am happy to be able to experience it. Peerless.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Baked Bread, Honey, Malt, Pastries\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Okay, I’m finally back on Steepster after a nearly week-long absence. It’s not that I haven’t been drinking tea during this time, I just haven’t been posting reviews. Specifically, I have been working my way through larger amounts of several teas I have had for some time, one of which was this Yunnan black tea.I prepared this tea gongfu style. After a very quick rinse to open the tea up, I steeped 6 grams of loose tea leaves in 4 ounces of 205 F water for 5 seconds. This infusion was followed by 14 subsequent infusions. Steep times for these infusions were as follows: 7 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, 1 minute, 1 minute 15 seconds, 1 minute 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes.Prior to the rinse, the dry tea leaves emitted pleasant aromas of chocolate, malt, and wood. After the rinse, I detected aromas of brown sugar, toast, honey, sweet potato, and molasses as well. The first infusion produced a similar aroma with hints of butter, fruit, and vanilla bean. In the mouth, I picked up on gentle notes of dark chocolate, molasses, butter, wood, toast, malt, and brown sugar underscored by subtle hints of earth, honey, sweet potato, and fruit. Subsequent infusions brought out impressions of vanilla bean, baked bread, apricot, orange, maple syrup, honey, smoke, raisin, sweet potato, moist earth, and plum. The later infusions were smooth, offering hints of minerals, bread, toast, smoke, and malt underpinned by a slight honey and fruit sweetness.I found this to be an extremely nice Yunnan black tea. It was a little more mellow than anticipated, but it had a tremendous amount to offer. It was definitely on par with the other Chinese black teas I have tried from Whispering Pines Tea Company. Of those I have tried so far, this one might be my favorite.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Apricot, Baked Bread, Butter, Chocolate, Earth, Honey, Malt, Maple Syrup, Mineral, Molasses, Plums, Smoke, Sweet Potatoes, Toast, Vanilla, Wood\\n</div>'], 'Polarity': [0.6333333333333333, 0.17500000000000002, 0.2531177156177156, 0.20744047619047618, 0.4, 0.4213636363636364, 0.16018707482993197, 0.2239583333333334, 0.3411064425770307, 0.11976784476784479], 'Mouthfeel': ' its not as thick as i would like in the mouthfeel.', 'Flavor Profile': {'Spicy': 0.5263157894736842, 'Char': 0.0, 'Sweet': 0.42105263157894735, 'Nutty': 0.05263157894736842, 'Floral': 0.0, 'Herbs': 0.0, 'Vegetables': 0.0, 'Grass': 0.0, 'Wood': 0.0, 'Earth': 0.0, 'Mineral': 0.0, 'Marine': 0.0, 'Berry': 0.0, 'Citrus': 0.0, 'Tree Fruit': 0.0, 'Tropical': 0.0}}\n",

I have not tried TeaVivre’s organic version of this tea, but I am guessing it is very similar. Yum. The tea I love at a cost I can live with drinking it everyday.Usual teapot method.', 'Let’s just get one thing clear here. This will probably not be news to most of you.Fujian black = OM NOM NOM NOM!!!That said, let’s move on.I should do a proper intro first. You see, you may have heard about this here <em>massive</em> order I put in with Le Palais des Thes recently. Massive. <em>Massive,</em> Steepsterites. When the boyfriend came home and saw the opened box, this is what happened.“That’s for work, right?” says he.“Um, no…” says I.<em>I was being Looked At</em>“What?” says I, somewhat defensively.“That’s enough tea for an army!” says he.<em>innocent look</em> says I.That was when I decided to not tell him about <em>this</em> order, although it’s much more reasonable in size with only three different teas. And yes, the LPdT one <em>did</em> get slightly out of hand. Slightly.So the TeaVivre order arrived today. I have tinned it and hidden as much of the evidence as I could in my own room. I recently rearranged the Tea Corner slightly, so I’m counting on him not noticing the three extra tins that have appeared.If he sees them, he’ll mock me for weeks.So that’s the current status in my house. Yup. Sneaky tea. At least I don’t have to hide it in a desk drawer like I do with chocolate when I get cravings after having told him to help me cut down on snacking and sweets.Now, tying it all back to the very beginning of the post, anybody who has known me for a while will know that when it comes socks-in-orbit-awesome, nothing, and I do mean <em>NOTHING,</em> surpasses Tan Yang in my opinion. I love all Fujian blacks, I’ve never met one in recent history that I didn’t, but Tan Yang is the very definition of tea perfection for me. Bai Lin came close, but not quite there. A little less wild, a little more well behaved. I love the wacky feel to Tan Yang that I get some times, when it seems to display multiple personalities between steeps, and often between sips if brewed Just So.I have to say that the first sip of this one had me eyeing the cup suspiciously. I have, it appears, been drinking the wrong Bai Lin. This one hits almost all the markers that I love about Tan Yang. The only one missing the wacky feeling, but I can’t tell that from just one cup anyway. It might be there.There’s nothing well behaved about this. It’s loud and self assured. It marches into the room shouting, “BAI LIN IS HERE! HI FANS!” It’s not at all subtle, but it seduces me all the same.But I expect you lot wants to know about my experience in more descriptive terms as well. The aroma is malty sweet and a bit grainy. I got a whiff of caramel, but only because the flavour told me to look for it. You see, this has a pretty good caramel-y note. It’s mostly in the aftertaste and it reminds me of the dulche de leche (an expensive and rare luxury) I had on toast for breakfast this morning. The body of the sip is all long and grainy and dark, but at the very front was where I found the real surprise. Sort of prickly, kinda floral and kinda almost pseudo-smoky! More floral than smoky, but it was definitely pointing vaguely in that direction.And that, I expect, is what broke the Good Boy image for this one. That’s the sort of thing I expect from Keemuns and Tan Yang. This tea definitely feels male to me, which is peculiar, because all other Bai Lins I’ve had struck me as rather more female tasting.(Yes, flavours occasionally have genders. They sometimes have colours too.)', 'Started the morning off with this and another from teavivre, in part because i wanted to make sure i got my sipdowns in today before i had to go out and run errands in in part because i wanted to start the day off with something black and delicious. This fits that perfectly! I’ve had this one before and really enjoy it. I haven’t restocked it into my cupboard except as samples though, because i’m trying to get my cupboard under control. it’s always nice to revisit it though as it’s always a tasty cup.', 'This was one of the early teas I experienced when Teavivre first introduced me to fine loose leaf tea. I remember being blown away. I added some to my recent order as it has been a long time since I last had Bailin Gongfu and I wanted to see if it stood up to my earlier experience and my memories. The first thing I’ll note is looking back through my notes, this was usually accompanied with food – and almost always food that is bad for the waste line but good for the soul. I don’t currently have any good junk food, so sad as that sounds I’ll proceed. Opening the package fills my nose with cocoa. Brewed this is cocoa, malt, and honey. Man this stuff is almost like junk food all on its own without the bad stuff. It really is as good as I remember.', 'It is coming time soon to order more of this perma stash tea.  Always my go to tea in the morning when I don’t feel like trying something new. Its perfection. Dependable. Delicious. I can feel some sickness coming on … once I am fully awake I am going to switch to some green tea to combat whatever is trying to take over me.', 'I made a batch of my astragulus ginger lemon tisane earlier this afternoon to share with Tony, &amp; then I enjoyed a cup of this delicious sweet cup of caramel yum.

It’s nice to have a straight black tea, without all the crazy flavours and just get back to basics. This one is so dark and rich. I may have over-steeped it, but I am still enjoying it.', 'Thank you Angel for the generous samples. Now to this lovely tea. When I opened the tiny sample bag and smelled the aroma of soft cocoa I knew that I would be in for a treat. So rich and full of flavor. I am getting flavors similar to the Zhi Gung Fu. I saw this was noted by another reviewer also. I only used half of the sample bag for the first cup. For cup 2 I am using the rest of the bag. I will give it a shorter steep time and see what happens. This such a fine tea. One sip and you are in tea heaven. I am brewing this basket style and quite frankly I am saving some for later. It is very uplifting and one of the finest black teas I have had the pleasure to sip. Now I see what my fellow Steepsterites have been gushing about.

However, during the tea gathering, an idea was brought up about pairing food with tea. I believe that Andrew (LP) mentioned that there’s very little known about food &amp; tea together, as much as there is with either wine or beer paired with food. Yet, here is an artist who has accomplished something so complex, unique, complicated, and undiscovered—and with his blends—has made a whole new kind of tea. He uses quality leaf with quality ingredients. And although I’ve never disliked anything thus far (I haven’t tried the Mediterranean Chicken Tea, as I’ve heard/read it called) while drinking LP’s stuff. And with that said, this is why I’ll always support his projects/teas no matter the cause.

It’s a blend of Assam and Kenyan leaves, much like many others of its kind. Somehow it tastes fresher though. Punjana is blended by the Thompson Family in Belfast, Northern Ireland.Many reviews of teas say they’re strong, but not bitter. I’m always skeptical when I read that, but to me it applies for this blend. In short, I have a new everyday tea to enjoy(and always lots of other teas to always try too.) I recently tried their Signature Blend and will do a separate review for it some time, but my taste buds like this one a little better.', 'Dad replaced the water filter yesterday. My morning cuppa builder’s tasted weird and weak today :(I better run the tap for a few minutes before I use it for my tea.', 'A wonderfully smooth, hearty blend of Indian teas. One of my favorites to wake up to, or for a relaxing evening.Don’t expect tang, but instead a warming embrace.', 'Thompsons Terrific Tea! haha this was the blend that first introduced me to the Thompsons family! The memories! I always have a pack in my cupboard – just wouldnt feel right without it! This is my go-to tea, always hits the spot', 'Ah yes…this was the tea that introduced me to the blends the Thompsons family had to offer. I never would have guessed a wee factory in Northern Ireland was where this delicious tea was blended!

It seems my tastes are changing and I’m craving unflavoured tea more and more frequently these days, and adding milk to my black teas, flavoured or not, far less frequently. This morning I decided to start my day with a cup of this, mostly because I wanted a straight black and this was the first one I came across. I didn’t have any particularly strong feelings about it before then, but it was so smooth and delicious that as soon as I finished my first cup I went to resteep the leaves, only to find that I’d thrown them out without really thinking. So I got it back out of my cupboard, measured out the leaf and found that my baggie was empty. Sad moment. I’m going to resteep the crap out of the leaves this time.This was a beautiful blend. Each tea adds its own element and combined this is just the smoothest, most flavourful yet delicate house blend I’ve ever tried. I’m not at all surprised because as I’ve already said – probably multiple times – Stacy had a real gift for sourcing the best single origin teas, and this is basically a showcase of the best of the best. It’s malty, deep and chocolatey rich with bready notes, and some lighter citrus and floral notes, too. There’s a beautiful honey note which threads its way through the whole thing so that it glides across your tongue and dances on your palate. I’m not the best at describing natural notes from teas and I’m definitely not doing this one justice, but it was really a masterpiece and I’m going to miss it a heck tonne. Honestly I have three of the four elements in my collection and I might try to recreate it as best I can.', 'What a wonderful blend this is! Where the breakfast blends I’ve been drinking lately are blunt force objects, this one is a positive symphony of flavors, each perfectly in tune with the other. There’s a lot going on—malt, honey, cocoa, stone fruit, that perfect hit of astringency—but it works. And I suppose it’s no wonder, given that it contains two of my favorite straight blacks: the inimitable PTA and luscious Giddapahar Darjeeling. Teas like this are the reason I still miss Butiki. If I could get my hands on more, it’d be a definite restock; as it is, I’m going to savor my last few cups on long, slow weekend mornings like this one.', 'Totally lost track of time today helping Mum organize/purge the house. Never got past my first steep. ACK!!! So I threw this in the fridge for a cold steep, as caffeine at this hour could slay me. I’m excited to see how it turns out :P', 'I don’t know what came over me this morning, but an unflavored tea seemed to be the thing to drink.  I had a combination of excitement and trepidation, as I had heard a great deal about this tea. Trepidation unfounded, as this was lovely This was gorgeous, light and delicious. The flavors could have come across as heavy and solid and unforgiving as a block of solid tea. This has got a lightness to it, which makes the flavors glow. I think a slice of lemon would do well. I’ll try that next!', 'I brewed this up this morning and was quite excited given the rave reviews this tea has been getting but tbh I was disappointed. It’s good but I find I enjoy the individual elements much more than the combination of them together. I just find them to be richer in flavor where as this is muted to me (and I know that is probably just me since so many others love this). However, my lack of love for this tea makes it that much easier to happily pass this along to another steepster who will enjoy it far more than I ever could.', 'thank you <strong>Kittenna!</strong> This is one of those tasting notes that makes me sad because I was never able to pick this up myself. And it’s good. i very much appreciate the share from Kittenna today and will be resteeping this until the flavour is dead. This is juicy and delicious and everything in between here and there and everywhere. I am a fan! I don’t get a lot of chocolate notes from this one but that’s ok by me. I can mostly smell them versus tasting them. Seriously. delicious! So sad i missed out on this one.. <strong>sniffles</strong>', 'Got this tea in my last Butiki order. Hadn’t tried it till yesterday. On Steepster it says there are a LOT of flavors. Kinda diverse, and I wasn’t sure what to think. But then in tasting notes it acted like it’s a really chocolate-y, malty tea. Which made me decide to buy it in the first place. XD So I wasn’t exactly sure what to think going into this one. But I was actually pleasantly surprised. It was rather fruity. I tasted raisins and plums. Pretty bready too. Kinda malty, but not overly so. Maybe a bit chocolate-y, but nothing too noticeable. Overall it was a delicious tea and I’m really glad I got to pick some up!

I am not finding it to be overly malty or chocolatey, in fact it’s reading on my tongue as being incredibly, wonderfully JUICY. Like an explosion of slightly fruity, slightly malty tea with definite honey notes.Truly, it doesn’t even matter to me, because ultimately when it comes down to it, it’s just so full of flavor and juiciness – such a smooth mouthfeel.I’m on steep 2 for this morning. I’m not even missing my daily AM coffee that I’ve been having regularly since going back to work! (6:30am wake ups don’t agree with my delicate composition :))Anyway, no big surprise here. Another Butiki fave that I will mourn when it’s gone.', '(Brewed to my own specifications.) Method: 2.5tsp/10oz pre-boiling 2min 30secWow, this is really something lovely. It’s dark and rich while maintaining a lightness in body. It’s malty, but not heavy. Each sip begins with a strong and somewhat bitter cocoa flavor. There are undertones of damp leaves, wet earth, wood. It then smoothly transitions into a springy, plummy fruitiness. There’s something like raisins there. But there’s also tang. Following quickly behind are notes of honey, baked bread, and butter. The flavors are thick and coat the lining of your tongue. After, I notice those flavors receding as floral, somewhat vegetal notes take their place. These I presume come from the Giddapahar. I haven’t tried any of the teas on their own, so it’s difficult to say. A touch of bitterness rests on my tongue, along with nuttiness, and that light floral finish. I’m impressed. It’s been a while since I’ve had a tea so complex. It took a lot of concentration and discernment to be able to pull every flavor apart. I’m out of practice! I would love to have this tea in the morning. After consideration, I believe it would best be saved for slow, reflective mornings…and mornings with someone special.

This is so fragrant with caramel, honey, and fruit. So fresh smelling. The leaf is tan buds and darker brown leaves. Gorgeous.I used an extra large scoop, simply because I could. 12oz of heavily steaming almost boiling water and my press. The steep was a little less than two minutes.As soon as the water hit the leaf, the already wonderful aroma came into full bloom with a scent like wine. It was also malt but not heavily so. Oh My Goodness this smells good. In my press this is deep golden in color. It is more orange as it pours into the mug. The wet leaf looks like chocolate shavings.The sip is so rich. It is even more fruity wine-like in the sip than in the scent. It is caramel and honey. It is malt and sweet. As the cup cools I notice a wheat component. It is not real yammy like Golden Tips, or heavily chocolate like Bailin Gongfu. Yet it is kind of in that same flavor range. The aftertaste is strong and lasting. It is sweet, wheat, and maybe yeast. It does seem a bit drying, which is as close to a negative comment as I can make.I had time for three cups. Amazingly, the first cup was the lightest and the third the darkest. The fruit like wine taste fades after cup one but the other flavors intensify. I don’t know how many cups this would go. I may try to continue with the same leaf tomorrow and see.This is simply perfection in a cup. I haven’t looked at the other reviews and frankly it doesn’t matter. Maybe it is just my mood today, but by my scale this is as close to a 100 (my first) as I have ever tasted in a black tea. Bravo!Glorious sample supplied by <strong>Teavivre</strong>.', 'Good morning Steepsterites! My dad is 80 years old today. Mom turned 79 on xmas eve. They live in Florida, so I don’t get to see them as often as I’d like, but I chat on the phone with them pretty much every day. It’s a bit scary watching your folks grow old, seeing them become children again in some ways, but I’m really grateful. I’ve always had a good relationship with my mom, my relationship with my dad was not so good. It took a long time to heal, a lot of song lyrics written, a lot of journaling. The path to peace is always acceptance &amp; forgiveness, it seems, &amp; honesty. Dad &amp; I understand each other now, we’ve worked out our issues. I’m grateful for that!This tea is a comforting cup of rich buttery sweet potatoes. Nothing bright here, nothing brash. It’s not particularly bold. It’s a quartet of clarinet, viola, Cello, &amp; Alto Flute.', 'This tea is so far superior to the one from Teavana in my opinion, and it is probably half the price. It is a tea that can go with any mood, any food. I served it today to youngest and her friend and I forgot to put milk and sugar on the table. It didn’t matter. They drank it plain. I think both girls have been trying to drink their tea straight for a couple of months now, and this one is an easy one to learn to like like sans additions.Mercuryhime got me thinkkng…and looking around. She mentioned having to clean when you invite people to tea. Well, Mercuryhime, if I am ever in the area, don’t clean for me because I just want to be with you! Let your dogs lick my face, let me get dirt on my shoes in your garden, I will be happy! I love getting to know new people and learning from them.BUT…I am going to bare all and tell you PART of what is cluttering my kitchen right now. Remember, my kitchen is large though my house is small, because this was a kitchen/den combination when the house was built, with a tiny dining area. A den was added, so the old “den” is now informal dining and school table and the formal tiny dining corner is now the laundry area and bread making center.Okay, here goes. Tomatoes everywhere on the island, cucumbers because I am about to make pickles, teapots all down the counter, a Breville, a mixer, two ceramic egg holders because I don’t refrigerate my eggs. (Fresh, unwashed eggs have an antibiotic coating from the hen.) There is a cooling rack out still from muffin making, a cast iron Dutch oven that I can’t put away due to my surgery and am waiting for someone else to do It, two jars of kefir fermenting, a compost pail, some recycling that hasn’t been carried out, lots of spices, a mortar and pestle full of eggshells that need to be distributed, a bowl of fruit. I have my mother’ s and godmother’s rolling pins and my MIL’s old hand powered egg beater. All sitting out or displayed. It really does look like an old general store in there. On the fireplace, there are candles, lanterns, a candle box, a paper towel tube (WHY?), and some magazines. That is probably less than half. LOL!Does anyone else dare tell what is sitting out in their kitchen? Several OCD people probably just fainted. I am sorry! :DFYI: we eat almost all our meals at the little tea table in the “L” of the living room because of all the stuff in the kitchen.', 'Another delicious tea that i took out with me today. Early morning start today to make it in to the spa with nicole for a girls day out. Mani/Pedis, lunch, movie and then dinner with my other half, her husband and the little one. Followed by a short game before coming home late. I was glad i made the effort in the morning to brew up two travel mugs to bring with me :) I needed it by the afternoon!', 'Sipping on this while continuing my Family Ties viewing / putting off working on the program notes until tomorrow. I was about to do the H&amp;S Holiday Tea for the third time in two days, then I realized – wait. Black Friday’s in four days, Cyber Monday’s in a week, and I’m planning a tea splurge regardless of whether or not the companies in question are offering discounts or not. My cupboard’s not enormous by Steepster standards, but I better sip down a few things up in here.I oversteeped this by a bit, so it’s a little bitter. But still good and smoky. Little mushroomy, but that might be the oversteeping. I wish I could say more, and more intelligent stuff. But it’s enjoyable.', 'Sipdown, 139. I really need to make some (figurative) room in my cupboard because I am about to have a bomb of oolongs from Teavivre dropped on me soon. I figured I should try to get through this last batch of teas that they sent me, so that’s the goal for the next few days.I’ve tried this one with my western black tea methods (2tsp, 12oz water, 3 minutes) at the recommended steep temp, and a pseudo-gongfu method, which is the whole sample pouch for a shorter period of time. I find this one yields similar results for me in each method. Even though it’s a Fujian tea, it has some earthy-potatoey Yunnan-like notes to it. There’s a hint of grains like I might expect from a Fujian, but also a very slight cocoa-powder note. All in all I definitely enjoy this tea, and it seems to be a great example of a golden monkey. Now if I loved golden monkeys, I’m sure this tea would be at the top of my list.', 'My third round of Teavivre teas arrived today! I couldn’t wait to get home and get started.This is my first Golden Monkey. I know, right? How could I be such an avid black tea drinker, but missing out on this? Anyway, I opened the packet to smell it as the water heated, as usual. Faintly smoky, with hints of cocoa, hay, fruit, and malt. So deliciously promising.Even after only two minutes, the tea was a dark red amber. It smelled less smoky and more malty, still reminding me of fresh clean hay. The taste, of course, is fantastic. It reminds me a lot of some of Teavivre’s other black teas… they all have a distinct cocoa-like taste that I’m starting to think may come from their tea region itself. It’s delightful, and I haven’t tasted it anywhere else so far. But it’s difficult to describe. I know it may seem weird, but it kinda tastes the way a new, clean piece of printer paper smells. I’m also getting the yam/sweet potato taste others have mentioned, and I really like it. This is such a savory, satisfying black tea.', 'I enjoyed this tea yesterday with a dark chocolate banana muffin. Let me tell you, it was amazing that way. The malty notes are greatly pronounced and they complemented each other perfectly. Now I need to make more muffins…haha.  But seriously, I do thoroughly enjoy this tea.', 'Free sample from <strong>Teavivre</strong>. Thank you.Opening the packet I thought, “This smells like tea.” What I mean by that is that it smells more like the teas I grew up with, rather than the teas I drink now. Interesting reaction. Is this tea used in English breakfast teas at all? Or maybe one like it is. The leaves are tiny curls of dark brown mixed with golden curls. They look great.I put 8g in a 250ml pot and set it to brewing according to Teavivre’s instructions. The liquor is thick and dark, a reddish brown colour. The aroma is malty, almost what I have come to expect from Teavivre. No complaints on my part for that. I like it. It lacks the cocoa undertones (or even overtones in some cases) that other black teas I have tried from Teavivre have, but it is great all the same. There is no astringency at all as far as I can tell. The liquor tastes as thick as it smells. It is malty with a fruity Christmas cake flavour underneath. The taste as I exhale after swallowing is sweet and that sweetness lingers on my tongue as a delicious aftertaste. Then the qi hits me and suddenly I feel slightly warmed and relaxed at the same time, especially in my legs of all places. How peculiar!The second steep is less malty and has more grain to it, but still has all the excellent notes of the first steep. I expect this process to continue with the third steep. I might share that one later, but right now I am just going to enjoy this tea as it deserves to be enjoyed, instead of intellectualising (is that a real word?) my enjoyment of it. When I am not focusing on what I can taste in it, I can feel it resetting my concentration so that I can return to my work with a clear mind, ready to progress on the next section.Overall this is another excellent tea from Teavivre, but I really do need to eat more sweet potato so I know what they mean in their tasting notes! Still, maybe I can divine that flavour from the next two pots. This sample is large enough for three generous pots, so a huge thank you to <strong>Angel</strong> and <strong>Teavivre</strong>. I can’t wait to try the rest of the sample, then I shall have to buy some of this for myself.', 'This was a generous sample from <strong>TeaVivre</strong>. Thank you so much!Hmmm…I may have gone too long on the steep time, because this had a touch of astringence to it. And that was only at 2 minutes! I did use 4.5 grams of leaf for 500 ml. of water, though, so maybe that might be part of it…The smell of this was slightly smoky, which I’m coming to realize is a general characteristic of Fujian teas. It wasn’t ash tray smoky, luckily, so I didn’t feel too apprehensive about trying it. Especially because of an underlying starchy/malty note that adds some extra (and very pleasant) complexity.The taste is…raisins. Rather, the taste plus astringence equals raisins. Kind of fruity and dry but also that vague sulphur-y flavor which I think is what that smoky smell turned into. Interestingly, even though it’s dry it also has a thick texture that coats the mouth – this is quite the maze of contradictions!I wonder if this is related to the Tan Yang <strong>Angrboda</strong> loves so dearly? It’s just that she described that tea pretty much how I think this one tastes. They are from the same province, so I suppose it’s possible.Anyway, I’m going to try a little less leaf or a little less steeping time or some combination of the two the next time I brew this – I’m curious to see what will happen. Tonight’s preparation yielded a good tea, but I’m pretty sure I didn’t get everything out of it that I could have.I will say that it definitely has a TON of character and it’s a shame human error had to go and get in the way. :( Oh, well – at least there can be a next time!'], 'Polarity': [0.17566964285714287, 0.21439393939393941, 0.11572115160824831, 0.10458333333333333, 0.17876984126984127, 0.19215686274509802, 0.08753555967841684, 0.35462962962962963, 0.17004076086956524, 0.03823232323232323], 'Mouthfeel': '', 'Flavor Profile': {'Spicy': 0.6666666666666666, 'Char': 0.0, 'Sweet': 0.26666666666666666, 'Nutty': 0.06666666666666667, 'Floral': 0.0, 'Herbs': 0.0, 'Vegetables': 0.0, 'Grass': 0.0, 'Wood': 0.0, 'Earth': 0.0, 'Mineral': 0.0, 'Marine': 0.0, 'Berry': 0.0, 'Citrus': 0.0, 'Tree Fruit': 0.0, 'Tropical': 0.0}}\n",

Either way, it was a generous sample in my recent order from <strong>Stacy</strong> – thanks!I haven’t found myself to really be a fan of many black tea blends, mostly because I don’t like a lot of straight black teas. However, this one’s not too bad. I’m getting raisiny flavours, as if it has Premium Taiwanese Assam in it, combined with other black teas that I can’t identify that give it a bit of a hay-y yet sweetish flavour. It’s not too robust to drink straight – after a three minute infusion, I’m not experiencing any astringency at all. I imagine, however, that it would hold up well to milk.Honestly, I just requested a sample of this one out of curiosity, which has now been satisfied :D For a black blend, it probably deserves an 85+ rating, though I’d probably rate it myself closer to about 65 as that’s where it falls for me.', 'Ah, I am extremely cranky.

No heart.Anyyway, I woke up cranky, knowing I’d be going into an overnight shift of this, so I brewed a cup of this hoping it would not only wake me up but cheer me up. I’ve never had an Irish Breakfast Tea before. Honestly I ordered it simply because it’s a black tea and has the word Irish in the title. I love everything Irish :). Smells beautiful…like raisins and earth. I already felt myself cheering up.This was a suprisingly nice black tea, malty and raisiny black tea goodness. I drank the cup slowly letting the caffeine wake me up and put me in a slightly better mood.

I found it in a box under some Upton samples, that I am sure I checked at least 4-5 times before.Anyhow, this brews a beautiful deep copper cup. The tea is robust, but not bitter or astringent. Still a little more Ceylon and less Assam than I’d like in a Ceylon/Assam Irish blend. However, it’s the best Irish blend I’ve tried in awhile. I also enjoy the fact that it’s organic. This will go into my rotation of breakfast teas and will be my preferred Irish Breakfast. Good stuff.', 'Breakfast is over, and I’m relaxing in my sun room, sipping this bold tea, still trying to wake up.

So, I am only logging my morning pot of tea now.This is a really nice Irish Breakfast. As others said, it perhaps has less Assam and less maltiness than many Irish Breakfasts. But I believe its characteristics make it really versatile blend. When not enjoyed alone, I think this would go well with everything from a traditional Irish breakfast to lighter fare such as toast and fresh fruit.', 'Oh my. I have had Irish Breakfast tea before. Usually, I brew it to the extreme. You know, could easily work as pine tar in baseball. Not much on flavor but provides a good kick in the pants in the morning.

Absolutely and positively perfect.I steeped this one multiple times because that’s what I do.<strong>1st steep</strong>-3.30 minutes Nice dark brew but not astringent at all. Very smooth and chocolaty with a nice malty flavor. A bit of fruitiness on the finish.<strong>2nd Steep</strong>-7 minutes Raisin-like sweetness and a bit of maltiness.

Sure, I have fun trying out dessert teas, but when it comes right down to it, it’s cups like this that made me a tea lover to begin with.The raisin note reminds me of Premium Taiwanese Assam, except without the cocoa or cinnamon and with more KICK to it. It’s technically 9:30PM right now, but I can definitely see myself reaching for this in the morning for that kick in the pants. I tend to crave sweet more in the evening so I added half a teaspoon of golden sugar in a 12oz serving, but it definitely does NOT need it, just what I was in the mood for at the moment.A toasty sort of taste follows the raisin note and lingers in your throat. I’m loooovin’ it. This is heaven in a cup.Cupboard staple? Yes, yes, yes.Delicious. If this is how Ireland drinks their tea, then I gotta get meself on a plane.Edit: This tea is very good value.

More. Overwhelming. Aromas.This is either going to be the best Yunnan I’ve had, or it is going to be so bold and sweet I’ll absolutely hate it. But, that will be a matter of my taste, not the quality of the tea. “Rare” grade, indeed.1st ~ Aaannnd… mmmmmmm… Oh. Man. When I go through these long stretches of saving money buying tea at the market instead of ordering direct, I forget just HOW MUCH BETTER these teas are than what you can get from big retailers.For all the boldness in the leaf this is a remarkably shy first steep. Cacao (not cocoa), fig and a mild finishing astringency which keeps the sweetness from becoming too cloying.2nd ~ This is making me want to either re-locate my work computer into the kitchen next to the kettle, or move the kettle into the office next to my computer. I can’t keep my cup full long enough or refill it quickly enough.This tea helps you understand why people started adding honey to lesser teas. The roasted fruit is mellowing into more like a buckwheat honey (if you have never had very dark amber, buckwheat honey, it will COMPLETELY change how you think about honey) and the balance of the fast sweetness and lingering dryness remains intact.3rd ~ Already even softer. Perhaps the exchange for this amazing flavor profile is that the candle is burning at both ends and we may only get but a handful of steeps from the leaf.All in all, a FANTASTIC leaf.', 'tired and long day tomorrow..so keeping it quick tonight..i hope.

Bumped the rating up a little because it as much tastier this time around than i remembered….that being said, i tried this a long time ago, and i know my tastes have changed.', 'A Yunnan that fits my usual tea profile. This was very good. The leaves are a large percent golden, and long and curly. They brew up into a lighter version of the typical Fujian blacks I drink. The taste is smooth, and sweet, with a light smokiness that fills out the base. It is not as full tasting as darker deas, but still lovely and satisfying.', 'Note: the crop reviewed here was purchased from Upton in late December 2013.This tea is OK steeped Western style, but seems to really shine with Gong Fu treatment. All experiments used 1 tsp (2.3 grams) of leaf.I tried two forms of Western steeping, both with 6 ounces of water. The more traditional 4:30 steep produced a powerful aroma of raw honey with an undertone of chocolate chip cookies baking in the oven, but was somewhat less impressive in the cup with just a muddled note of the underlying sweetness that was hinted at in the aroma. Two subsequent 6 minute steeps brought faint reflections of the first cup along with a hint of pepper in the final steep. Modifying this with 1 / 2 / 3 / 4 / 5 minute steeps produced a better cup, especially in the early steeps, with the honey aroma translating into a nice honey sweetness in the cup. Pepper again made an appearance in the later steeps. The liquor varied across the spectrum of red-amber.It was the Gong Fu treatment, however, that made me order more of this tea. I pulled out my 90 ml pot, skipped the wash and jumped right into a series of 15 second steeps until the flavor started to fade around the eighth one, whereupon I lengthened each steep considerably. Early steeps smelled and tasted like raw honey, with Yunnan spice slowly increasing as I went. The sweetness morphed from honey to something less distinct out through the 16th steep (a hail-Mary at 10 minutes), but never left. The liquor was a beautiful golden color that seemed to glow in my little clear glass teacup. This was an outstanding session which I’ve repeated several times since.I’ve never tasted legendary teas such as Golden Fleece. Until I get that chance this stands as one of my favorite Yunnan blacks.', 'Ohhhhh so good. I ordered a large-ish bag of this after tasting a sample. This morning I made a little pot of it, and I broke out in a big smile after the first sip. Rich, mellow, a little spicy but not identifiably peppery.

Pretty much all i can say about it.', 'This is another perfect tea in my book. Just deep and dark enough for the morning, but good anytime really. When I opened the bag and sniffed, it was a delightful sensory confusion. Fruitcake? I finally settled on apricot or maybe even ripe persimmon, although it has been so long since I had a persimmon that I can’t be sure of that. There is more, but it is elusive to me. Brewed, it looses the fruitiness and again is hard to describe, I guess cookie is a good description of the flavor. Maybe an old fashioned sugar cookie? I would love to hear other thoughts on this one, the reviews on Upton are as confused as mine. I got 160 grams/5.6 ounces and I was not willing to review this until I ordered it again. So within a week I placed a second order for 320 grams. It is that good.', 'Thank you TeaExplorer for your generous sample. This tea is sweet, bold, cocoa and stone fruit notes. I like it.

In fact, I’m still having a difficult time deciding whether Royal Gold is worth its significantly higher cost, relative to ZY84…but these notes are about Upton’s Yunnan Rare Grade, so I’ll stay focused on that.There is certainly ZERO problem deciding whether ZY84 is worth its cost. It is a superb value in a Yunnan gold tips tea. The bag aroma is astonishing. Yeah, I know…it sounds like hyperbole, but anyone who has had the pleasure of sticking El Schnozzola in a freshly opened bag of ZY84 knows exactly what I’m talking about. The fruitiness is remarkable.It’s less fruity in the cup, but I don’t care. It’s still an extraordinary tea. My notes on the first cup say, “It’s a richly flavored, naturally sweet tea, but it has no single dominant characteristic. There’s some leather, some spice, more malt, a bit of cocoa; it’s a melange, really.” (4 infusions in the first tasting.)Second tasting: “…has a smooth, almost creamy mouth feel. There’s a light sweetness on the tongue, and a lingering light sweetness in the finish.” (4 infusions)Third tasting: “Magnificent tea. It has an intense cocoa-malty creaminess…”…and so on until I polished off the entire 80-gram bag — more than enough to explore this tea thoroughly.I typically use 8 grams of leave in 12 ounces of 208° water for the first two infusions (1:00 and 2:00 minutes, respectively). Then I reduce the water to 8 ounces or less with gradually longer steeping times for the subsequent infusions…up to 5 infusions.Is there Yunnan tea of this kind that’s better than ZY84? Yes, so for that reason alone I won’t give it a 100% rating. But so far I haven’t had any better Yunnan gold at this price point.UPDATE: Alas, Upton has raised the price of this tea…significantly. I haven’t tasted the new lot. Perhaps it’s better…although it’s difficult to imagine it being sufficiently better to justify the cost increase (nearly $11.00 per pound more than the previous price…and it wasn’t cheap then either). Too bad for Upton, but there IS better Yunnan gold, and I’ll buy that instead of ZY84. They’ve priced themselves out of consideration.', 'This one was surprisingly just above average for me. A smooth and tasty cup to be sure, but I’ve had better Yunnan and Fujian teas than this one. The leaves are huge with quite a few golden tips. It has a nice dose of cacao and maltiness in the flavor with a lingering bit of honey on the palate. It is definitely quite smooth and I’ve enjoyed drinking it, but nothing makes it really stand out for me from any other high quality Chinese black tea.

It’s very easy to be seduced by the burgeoning websites touting personal relationships with family farms in China or Estates in India. How much variety is too much? How often is the Chinese black tea from X an upgrade from the one you’ve been enjoying for a while? Maybe the answer is a resounding, “Variety is the spice of life!” But it’s a question I ask myself as I find fewer and fewer of my forays into the offerings of new (to me) sellers end up replacing the teas I’ve come to love and drink regularly.Now, this is not meant as a criticism of Joseph Wesley’s teas which I’m trying for the first time. I really enjoyed his high end Qimen (not reviewed yet) and this Bai Lin is certainly pleasant. But is the Qimen better than the ones I’ve had from Upton, a place I’ve been ordering from for years and from whom I can order a whole variety of excellent teas? Hard to say. When I go to the store, I can choose between 20 different kinds of olive oil or yogurt but the myriad of choices just makes me anxious (or maybe it’s just the fluorescent lighting).Anyway, back to this tea, which I’m finding hard to categorize.

I mean, I like the Golden Monkey teas that have chocolate notes in it, and GO is pretty good-not my favorite and still don’t know for sure if I’m gonna buy more again. Like I went into GO thinking it was gonna be super vanilla-y. So I was pretty disappointed when it was just chocolate tea basically, but it was more of a deep, richer chocolate…if that makes sense? So I liked it, and I still have a little left, I really should drink the rest soon to see if I still like it. Feel like I used to be bigger on things tasting like chocolate-but only like a deep richer chocolate like GO. I rarely even eat chocolate. If I do it’s because there’s caramel with it or it’s combined with matcha or something.  This tea kinda surprised me. It was a strong flavor but it really reminded me of milk chocolate which I reallyyyy do not like to eat. Even if it’s a chocolate bar filled with caramel it’s just not that good when it is milk chocolate.. White chocolate I like though. Dark chocolate, I have to be in the mood for and that’s becoming more and more rare.  Milk chocolate…just no.  So yeah, I mean, if you LOVE teas that have chocolate flavors this is one for you! It really is chocolatey. It also has hints of like wood….kinda musty actually-even though that sounds horrible, like the chocolate is the main flavor so it’s not bad.

It opens with notes of smooth, silky cream, caramel, honey and baked bread. There are whispers of cocoa along with an almond nuttiness that makes me think of marzipan. There’s a hint of dried apricot. It’s decadent and sweet like cake batter; it’s thick and full, like pudding. I wouldn’t call it a “heavy” tea. Body falls somewhere between medium and full.

It smells like French toast without syrup. It smells like a whole slew of delicious, mouth-watering pastries. The taste? It’s like apricot jam on buttered toast with a light dusting of cinnamon, paired with a tall glass of milk. It’s good. I’m still catching notes of honey, cream, and a tiny bit of malt. It’s soft, gentle, and buttery but it has so much flavor. I’m in awe. There are some brighter tones in this steep that are like white raisins or citrus, but they’re not intense enough for me to pin down.

The liquor is thick but it is not bitter or too bold at all. There is a slight spice, which I am unsure if it is supposed to taste like that or if it was the contamination, but either way, I like it. There is the sweet potato flavour but also a hint of some fruitiness, makes me think of dried fruit. I feel like I am getting a bit of burnt flavour, kind of like burnt caramel without the over the top caramel sweetness, but also it makes me think of charcoal.This one did not disappoint.

I think in this case, I would use a touch more leaf.The brewed aroma is dark wheat bread and tangy molasses with some raisin/prune notes. Isn’t it amazing how sometimes the aroma and taste of a tea are completely different? That’s definitely the case here. While the aroma is dark, the taste is a lovely melange of lighter, airier flavors. The bread is there, but now it reminds me of toasted light bread with just that slight crispness. I would also compare it to a buttery pastry. There are some oat-y notes along with the lightest touch of honey and golden raisin. Underneath all of these light flavors is a nice deep caramel richness. Oh, so creamy!I will say that there is the tiniest minerality here that leads me to believe I made it with tap water. Our roommate makes coffee in the morning, and he uses tap water. We’re out of coffee right now, but this morning there was some water in the electric kettle. I didn’t think anything of it, but it was probably tap water.

I’ve been giving him the choice between the JW samples three times now, and he <em>still</em> hasn’t chosen the lapsang souchong. Is this the act of Cornflakes-man, I ask you? This is very disturbing. Do you think it might be bodysnatchers? O.ONow, this one I would, had circumstances (ie shipping fees and my bank account) been different, have got a full tin of without even blinking. But, there were other choices that I also wanted a full tin of, both of which were new to me and with infinite potential for being Interesting, so I had to make do with a sample. Okay. I can live with that.This is one of those kinds of tea where I know for certain sure that I’ll like it without having to have to sample it first. The very name of it alone is worth the first 80 points on the Steepster scale. It’s not a type which has to prove itself to me first, like an Assam or a Ceylon does.There is a creamy sort of quality to the aroma of this one. I haven’t added anything to the cup, I never do, but it smells like there might have been a drop of cream in there somewhere. Apart from that it’s got that grain-y note that I love, but I’m not picking up too much in the way of cocoa notes.Once upon a time I had a Bai Lin. The first one I ever had, and it tasted like mandarins. Therefore this is a note I always look for, but have never found again. Well, that’s not true, it may have been there in others, but never to the same extent. For this reason my ideal BL tastes like mandarins.This one is grainy and cocoa-y and it has a sort of springy freshness to it. It’s a bit giddy, a bit bouncy. JW calls it elegant and sophisticated, but for me there’s a childish glee in it that doesn’t really equate ‘elegant and sophisticated’ at all.It does not, however, deliver on the mandarins. Oh well. Perhaps I’m chasing shadows. It’s very enjoyable all the same.', 'The scent of this tea is relatively mild compared to similar teas out there. I can definitely smell a light sweetness &amp; something that resembles bread, but there isn’t anything all that specific for my nose to pick out at the moment. Some teas slap you with a strong scent, but this one is so gentle!Sipping… This is such a smooth tea which makes it very enjoyable to sip! It’s not creamy or silky, but smooth and mild. The main flavor that I’m picking up is sourdough bread. I also detect a mild caramel note, but my tastebuds have to look for it. This tea has a beautiful flavor, but it’s very much a whisper. You have to take time to look for the subtle flavors and I think that’s what makes this tea special. This is certainly a lovely, calm (perhaps needy) cup of tea that is begs for one’s full attention!*A note about my second steep of this tea: I do detect some lemon notes (which could very well be the result of the “sour” character from the sourdough bread) mixed with the bready ones.. so I’m getting a something like an unfrosted, more rustic lemon loaf which is quite lovely!', 'i picked this tea at NYC Coffee and Tea Festival. I still have nice memories abt festival and meeting Joseph Wesley. he recognized my accent asking if i’m from Russia and also shared that he spent several months there. i had this tea several times but didnt recorded for some unknown reason. Today i prepared it western style 1tsp 200F 8oz 2 min This tea is rich,malty,chocolaty sweet with some nut notes. as it cooled all the flavors became more pronounced and meld into each other. i decided to increase the temp to 205F for resteep for 3min. Wow, 2nd steep is bolder, richer and flavorful. now I’m wondering if it would be a good idea to rinse it to open up leaves. I’m sure i can get one or two resteeps more.  I’m happy that i picked this tea and planning to restock once I run out of it.', 'First tea of the morning. The smooth sweet caramel is just what I need this morning to ease me awake gently. There is a bit of breadiness, a little bit of malt but the caramel is especially prominent for me this morning.

I lost track of time while I was steeping this and don’t know exactly how long it was. Anyway this is extremely smooooth, very elegant tea. Tastes lightly of malt and chocolate with that nice baked bread aroma. This is definitely an elegant tea. I wish I had more to say about it right now, but it is delicious.', 'Another fancypants JW tea from boychik, because she’s so generous like that. (:I like this one more than the JW Dian Hong Congfu, which surprises me a little. It’s been a LONG time, like nearly a year long, since I drank Teavivre’s Bailin Gongfu, but I remember it being rich, hearty, deep, and very full of the caramelized sweet potato and oat profile of nice Chinese black teas. Perhaps a side-by-side comparison is in order for this weekend; boychik sent me enough I can do that (thanks!). This one was sweet too, and had that quality of gentleness but also depth that the nicer Chinese teas often boast. I quite enjoyed it. I don’t know that these sweet potato Chinese black teas will ever be my top favorites, but they have a craft you can taste to them—how they manage to be so sweet with zero bitterness or astringency, soft but also so full of flavor—I’d never deny.', 'Tea of the morning……Just imagine a golden tipped Bai Lin. This is a wonderful tea. The leaves are golden, fluffy, and just a little bit fuzzy. It looks very similar to the golden tip version of Teavivre’s Dian Hong. But this is Bai Lin! I am getting notes of cocoa and honey, and I know this will be on my rebuy list. Really, it does not even seem out of the range of a golden tipped tea for price.

      "{'Tea Name': 'China Lapsang Souchong', 'Tea Ingredients': 'Not available', 'Tea Flavors': '<dd class=\"empty\">Not available', 'Tea Reviews': ['It has been a very long time since I reviewed this Lapsang Souchong from Happy Lucky’s Teahouse here in Fort Collins. It happens to be a tea that I’ve sent to England, Canada and all over the United States when sending out samples of tea over the past two years. I even sent some to David Duckler at Verdant to use as a rub! (I have my nerve!)Not too long ago, the Manager at the tea shop, Andy, had some ‘other’ Lapsang Souchong tea’s that he was sampling. Andy said that he had some tea’s for me to try…so several Lapsang Souchongs were lined up for tasting. Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh.None were as good as the original China Lapsang Souchong!  Why? Smoke without bitterness, depth of flavor and a little sweetness.All agreed that there’s no point changing a favorite tea of so many people! This is one good Lapsang Souchong!Personally, I’m never without a few ounces of this tea.  I grind it into a powder with freeze dried garlic and onion and sprinkle it on vegetables when steaming them (broccoli and cauliflower). I make meat rubs, and can’t wait until my daughter’s goats produce milk for cheese so that I can dust them with tea.For those who received this tea from me and loved it, you can now buy it directly online. There’s another Lapsang blend with toasted jasmine and orange that’s called Lion and Lamb (less intense).  <a href=\"http://www.happyluckys.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.happyluckys.com</a>', 'Here’s another sample from <strong>Bonnie</strong> and a Thank You for another good Lapsang. I think I like this Lapsang using these times and temps, and doubt if I will ever use boiling water. I also used 1+ tsp leaf per 10 oz mug.The dry leaf smelled instantly of a campfire, with a certain sweetness that was inviting. This seemed less intense than my previous experience with Lapsang Souchong many years ago. As the tea began steeping, I couldn’t help but think, “Holy shishkabobs Batman!!”. The campfire smoke aroma intensified &amp; jumped out at me. Tobacco aromas lingered in the air as well. My cup liquor was a rather translucent brownish-red color, with pleasantly sweet aromas reminding me of those summer campfires, and tobacco smoke.The wet leaves smelled like tobacco smoke, with a definite ashy quality that cooled revealing new leather aromas and a natural sweetness. The flavors were surprisingly smooth and sweet, with tobacco and mild campfire smoke on my palate and the back of my tongue. Such a full flavor without being heavy.I steeped a second cup somewhere between 5 to 5.5 minutes. Campfires were still ablaze, but this time with more smoked tobacco aromas. Sniff….sniff…yes, I was actually getting whiffs of smokey bacon! My cup was slightly darker. Wet leaves smelled of deeper tobacco smoke, with a more pronounced ashy quality. Once cooled, there was a deeper leather aroma that was sweeter, reminding me of pipe tobacco. The flavors on my palate were heavier-smoked tobacco/ashy quality, with less campfire notes.Today I had two more cups yielding similar results. I decided to have a third cup resteeping the leaves, and was surprised by the continuing strength of the aromas and flavors. Through the second &amp; third cups, the aromas and flavors were full bodied and satisfying-yet mild, and not bitter and offensive.The demons of my previous experience with Lapsang Souchong are now conquered. I would imagine it’s much like the battles the Caped Crusaders would face every day, as Batman would exclaim, “To the Batcave, Robin!”. Sometimes, I wish I had a hermetically sealed cave, if only to store my tea there. :))Cupped: Monday &amp; Tuesday, June 4-5, 2012.Reviewed: Tuesday, June 5, 2012.', 'This sample was generously provided to me by Bonnie (still haven’t figured out how to make words bold). I was very curious about trying a smoked tea, and just a bit apprehensive. The aroma of the dry leaf is INTENSE pine smoke.My dad makes his own venison jerky in a backyard smoker using a combination of pinewood and hickory, and that’s what the smell of this tea reminded me of.The flavor proved to be more mellow, and I have to say I liked it a lot. I didn’t expect to like it this much. It was smooth and surprisingly light, and there is something very refined about it. It reminded me of grilled vegetables and a good cigar. Thanks again, Bonnie!Side note: I take my SAT’s tomorrow morning, wish me luck!', 'When I opened the bag of this tea that Bonnie sent me, I was hit with the smell of bonfires. I immediately knew that this was the tea I wanted to drink.The smokey aroma lingered as it steeped, and remained as I poured it although it was not quite as powerful as when I first opened the bag. It tastes just like I imagined it would. If you could drink a bonfire, this is exactly what it would be like. I really don’t know how else to describe it, the words have left me!This tea would be great on a summer night as well as an autumn night. It brings a comforting warmth with its smokiness and I feel that it would be a good tea with which to blend your own custom flavors with. I’ve got a couple pairings in mind to try out actually :)Bonnie mentioned steaming vegetables with a little of this tea &amp; I already know that I’m going to try it out tonight! We’re having company over and grilling out and I think some smokey vegetables would pair perfectly with the meal! I’ll make sure to let you know how it turns out! :)', 'Sample from <strong>Bonnie</strong>. Many thanks.The dry leaf is smoky. It reminds me of a winter’s day in the mountains. The campfire is burning (as is dinner, probably), the skis are stacked for the time being and the sun is out. Or maybe it is the smell of the smokehouse with racks of meat hanging in the rafters being cured. It really is that sort of smell. Very strong but utterly lovely.Drinking the tea, it is smoky, sweet and there is depth to it as waves of flavour break on my tongue. In some ways there is too much going on for my fuddled brain to sort it all out. It is fantastic though. As I drink the tea a beautiful lethargy comes over me. I am calmer and more relaxed. It is also somewhat cooling. It’s odd really. I feel kind of spaced by this tea but not in any unpleasant way. I have thoroughly enjoyed this tea and I’m off to make more right now.', 'I love the description! <strong>Bonnie</strong>, did you write that?This is a gift from Bonnie to help get youngest through geometry! I had ordered her sme from Teavivre but it will be about seven days before it gets here and she said she needed lapsang NOW! Bonnie was so sweet to send this, and it got here in just a couple of days!I had a small cup, not wanting to deplete her pot of tea too much. It is very smoky, but it is not at all offensive. The cup is a very clear orange and the smoke remains strong after steeping. The Lion and The Lamb left a pleasant ash smoke flavor after the sip, but this one has a little less aftertaste I think.The smoke is certainly strong enough, and youngest says she will be making it again tomorrow, and the next day, and the next!', 'Lesson of the day: Don’t judge a tea by its overwhelming campfire smell.I was feeling brave so I decided to once and for all tackle the sample <strong>Bonnie</strong> sent me of this tea. Smelling it once again I almost gave up immediately. It’s like every possible smoked item you could think of to the power of five. Campfires, liquid smoke, leather, tobacco, even after it’s steeped for almost 3 minutes, the cup of tea retains those same scents.Just keep telling yourself bacon.Finally brave enough to sip…it’s different. It’s spicy, smoky, and a little sweet. Since I’ve really never had anything smokier than the Smoky Chocolate from 52 Teas I am having a massive “oh my god this isn’t for drinking this smells like bacon dipped in liquid smoke kept in a leather purse!” reaction.Going to keep sipping though. If I can stand it this way then if I made it more like everyone else has I should have less of a problem in the future. Yay trying new things!It has a lot of depth but it’s not like being placed directly in the path of barbecue smoke while sitting at a campfire while wearing leather. Oh I can’t get used it yet! It’s just so weird. At least I seem to be having a better time with it than I had with ice skating.', '<strong>Bonnie</strong>! you inspired me to have some delicious Lapsang Souchong with your review the other day! thank you for the sample. Deeelicous!  This is malty and smokey and just overall good. Mmmmmm.  With a sprinkle of sugar and some milk, this is my cup of “country home”.  I’m trying to figure out how it differs from my other lapsang experiences… and I think the main thing is that I feel like the leaves are not just smoked… but burnt. In a nice way! Also, somehow, it tastes alot lighter… but rounder yet not as deep.  Mmmm. Thanks again Bonnie! xxx', 'Still the best Lapsang Souchong I’ve tasted. Wish I had more! I shared some with my roommate and she said she really liked it and it reminds her of bonfires with friends in high school.', 'An <strong>ENORMOUS</strong> thanks to Steepster Bonnie for this sample! I was looking forward to trying this blend since my last two experiences with smoky teas were delicious ones!When I opened the sample packet, my nostrils were bombarded with a powerful campfire aroma. In addition to the campfire effect, I also detected a smell reminiscent of one of my favorite snacking treats when I was a kid – Slim Jims!!!I steeped this tea at 212 degrees for four minutes as recommended by Steepster Bonnie. The smoky aroma continued to waft from the pot while brewing. The color of the steeped liquid was an inviting amber.The flavor of this tea is <strong>OUTRAGEOUSLY GREAT!</strong> It is rich, smoky, smooth, and steady. My tastebuds seemed to detect a hint of bacon in the flavor. There is also a subtle sweetness to this blend that reminds me of my favorite barbecue sauce. The smoky-themed aftertaste of this tea is light, sweet, and easy.As I’ve said before, smoky foods are in our blood as well as our stomachs down here in the Sunny South.

I am always tempted to gather my tea tray and a black tea or pu-erh when the clouds gather. Storms excite me. I huddle on the couch and watch between the pulled patio window curtains…wondering if there will be lightening over the mountain behind my house.There was a single Black Tea sample packed in the sample box from FONG MONG TEA this week. Lucky me!The flavor of this tea was very chocolatey with light malt (a bit like the Laoshan Black Tea from Verdant, but milder). This was sweet and wet on the tongue without astringency. An icy coolness was tingling my whole mouth and was perhaps what was refered to as mint in the Steepster notes. However, I didn’t taste mint like mint leaves…but felt the coolness. The flavor is light but has depth. Real character.So much of the world drinks Black Tea with additions. I try now and then to comment on tea for people who prefer drinking it that way.  With sweetening, this tea was enhanced a great deal (which is not always true). It became a very mellow chocolate dessert tea, with an aftertaste that was like taking a bite of pastry…and the flavor lingered! With milk, (cream in my case)…Heaven! I could serve this to the Royals! Superb!Here’s another bit of information I looked up. If you want to make your own “Bubble Tea” this is the tea to use. With sweetener, condensed milk, tapioca pearls, ice in a blender… this Taiwanese Tea is the type that is used. (Don’t put the pearls in until after blending of course and you can add fruit also).Really tasty tea. The flavor does not end. I mean it!

Is it possible that a black tea can taste vegetal?  I think so – to me anyway.  Smells like a warm inviting soup broth. Mmmmmm  Mushroom soup! Thats it!  This tea is one to savor – like being invited into a top chef’s kitchen and offered to sip from his big pot of slowly simmering soup. A “soup” that needs to be allowed to breathe and collect subtle nuisances of flavor over time. An aged soup perhaps? If there is such a thing.  This tea speaks to you as if it is knowing of secrets held within old trees, running streams that have spread gossip from one watering hole to the next and the memories of vegetation along the way. I think of immense spans of wooded lands, with the ripe smell of oak moss and dew on green leaves. Intoxicating!  Yes vegetal, spicy with flecks of sparks dancing on the top and tip of the tongue. Leather, woods, mushrooms, and chocolate notes bow like a gentleman before my palate.  A champagne tea that sparkles all the way down.  Happiness. Thank you Fong Mong Tea for this gift of a sample of your precious collection!', 'I definitely jumped on the chance to get some free samples from Fong Mong Tea, especially after early reviews for their teas were coming back really positive. I asked for this one in order to further my education of black teas! I’ve never had a black tea from Taiwan. The leaves are very long and spindly and difficult to dish out, but hopefully I got the right amount in my cup. They smell kind of chocolatey, but also kind of roasted and they remind me a bit of a dark oolong in aroma.After steeping the scent is fairly different from the black teas I’ve been drinking regularly. Almost floral? It’s kind of weird, but I think it’s just cause I’m not used to a black tea smelling floral. What a unique tea! It’s like I can taste more standard black tea flavors underneath it, but over top there is a flavor profile I am just not used to. I agree that I get the sensation of mint without actual mintiness. The chocolatey-ness comes out, but there are some… florals? I guess? It’s hard to put my finger on. Maybe piney and minerally, the way some dark oolongs are piney and minerally. Maybe a bit resin-y, like a retisna wine. I think I might have used a little much leaf as this cup has the tiniest hint of bitterness to it, mostly in the aftertaste.I reall appreciate the chance to try this tea, thank you Fong Mong! It isn’t a flavor profile I normally go for but I am definitely enjoying the cup.', 'Finishing this sample off, this is a very good tea :-) thanks to Fong Mong Tea for these awesome samples, I have one more oolong to try still I have enjoyed all my samples.', 'My samples arrived today from Fong Mong and of course I was excited and had to try one immediately. :)I used about 3g of tea in a 10 oz. mug, steeped Western style, my tea liquor is dark orange.This tea has a nice flavor profile, to me it seems malty with some cocoa and flowery notes and a quality that reminds me a bit of red wine. As the cup cools I am getting a lot of tannins which is definitely not something I look for in a tea because it makes my stomach feel queasy.At the moment I am not quite sure what to make of it but I think I will try a shorter steep in the morning and perhaps that will improve things for me.I am very grateful for the sample!', 'This is a sample I received from <strong>Fong Mong Tea</strong>.Of all the teas I have seen being sampled from Fong Mong, this was the one I was most excited about. Ruby #18 from A Southern Season was the first “expensive” tea I ever bought, one of the first I enjoyed without additives, the first that resteeped really well for me, and when Paul M Tracy sent me Black Ruby I was stunned by the rich, dark, raisiny flavor.It is amazing to steep a black tea for 5 minutes and then pour a yellow liquor into your cup! This is such a unique tea. I think this one has more flavor than the one from SS, and remember I really love that one! This will likely be a replacement for it, as it is quite good.This tastes more like an oolong than a black to me, and it is at once malty, fruity, sweet, and vegetal, light, yet having presence. Everyone should get to try a Taiwan Ruby tea!Thank you, <strong>Fong Mong Tea</strong>, for the opportunity to try this delightful tea!', 'I have tried a couple of different Sun Moon Lake Black teas now, and I’m really enjoying them. They are certainly unique!I love the aroma – rich and delicious with hints of fruit, and a little earthy, with notes of wood in the distance. It has a warm, comforting kind of fragrance.Delicious. Sweet fruit notes, hints of sour, bold and invigorating while at the same time soothing. Hints of chocolate and an earthiness to it that reminds me of mushrooms. It has a woody/vegetative kind of taste too. It’s nice and complex… it has enough interest to it that it keeps me sipping.', 'Sure…I have LIKED the other Sun moon Lake’s I have tried but THIS Sun Moon Lake is my fave thus far! There is ‘that flavor’ but magnified! It’s right where I want it to be! This is right up my alley! I’m grateful for this tea! It’s Dandy! It’s cocoa-E but with an aroma of hint of wine. It’s malty and smooth and the chocolate-E notes are quite remarkable.', 'Last of the free samples from Fong Mong, sorry this took so long to get to reviewing this one. This is my first Taiwanese black tea so I might not have the best reference points. It is so unlike the Yunnans I have been drinking lately, absolutely no roughness or savory notes. However it does remind me a smidge of Bailin Gongfu and Laoshan Black. It definitely has cocoa notes but it’s sweetness is not chocolaty but mineral (which is something I love). Of course I am brewing this starting at 15 secs so that does bring out a lighter more sparkling quality. Looking forward to spending the day with this and I have enough to brew western as well to compare.', 'I brewed this western style and easily got 9 full flavoured steeps!The leaves are long and unfurl beautifully. Scent is sweet, floral and lightly starchy. When brewed it has a slight syrupy mouth feel with cocoa, honey, and floral notes. Can be slightly malty depending how long it’s steeped for (longer steep = more malt) which is a nice addition. This tea takes milk well, but is <strong>so</strong> beautiful by itself that I much prefer it without.', '6 grams of dry leaf used for 370 ml of waterThe brewed tea has an aroma that reminds me of sweet black licorice. Musty, leathery. Faint aromatic, pungent floral. Fruity apricot-type note. Hint of sawdust.On the sip I’m detecting an astringency which is bordering on being overpowering (burt/dark chocolate note). The apricot and leathery notes are upfront in the flavour. Mild floral hints in the background. Mushroom-type note/mouth-feel. Licorice-like from the scent translates into the flavour. Maltiness close to the end of the sip.As the tea is allowed to cool a slight creaminess comes out in the taste. Char note near the end of the sip.Second infusion at 4.25 minutes. The flavour reminds me of roasted corn.', 'My first attempt at this may have fallen a tad short. I didn’t read the brewing instructions on Steepster before making my initial cup. Too little leaf and not brewed long enough!The second cup with more leaf and less water and a longer brewing time (see preparation details below) turned out much better.Upon opening the sample package from Fong Mong Tea, I notice how long the rolled leaves are – unusual compared to my other black teas. Almost a fruity smell wafts from the bag.The brewed cup is a nice clear-reddish color. The liquid is earthy, with a slight sweetness. There’s a smoothness to this tea – no sign of bitterness.This really does hit all the checkpoints that I’m looking for in a black tea! It’s delicious without additives (and that says a lot coming from someone who regularly defaults to throwing in a dash healthy dose of sugar and creamer)! Once I clear out my tea cabinet of the “other” morning tea, I’m putting in an order for this!Thank you for the wonderful sample, Fong Mong Tea!', 'Another strongly chocolate black tea from Taiwan. But this tea unlike the other black teas has a distinct flavor of a chocolate truffle covered in a bitter cocoa dust, what makes it a perfect accompaniment to sweet deserts and liquors. With the consecutive brewing the tea develops gentle sweetness and additional flavor of roasted peanuts. Wonderful tea and a keeper, particularly for the special occasions!', 'Free sample from Fong Mong TeaI was curious to taste this tea because it sounded like something completely new to me. Opening the packet, I was hit with a malty aroma and could see that the leaves were large.When I began brewing the tea I got more of the minty aroma coming off it. So, malt and mint. What would it taste like? There were undertones of other black teas I have drunk in this cup, but the dominant flavour was mint with a bit of malt. If anything the minty flavour was too much for me but I decided to resteep the tea with a slightly shorter steeping time and see what came up. I was able to reduce the mintiness a bit and that helped my enjoyment of the tea. Overall, I was not sure about this tea. It is clearly good quality and the flavours are there as advertised, but it did not enthrall me despite that. Now that I know what to expect from it, I think I need to experiment a bit with brewing parameters to get the best from it. Perhaps I shall learn to like it more, or perhaps it is just not to my tastes. Still, as I wrote before, it is a good quality tea and others may enjoy it more if the flavours suit them better. Thank you, Fong Mong Tea, for the chance to try this one.', 'So, I’m not sure I can properly rate or review this tea, because I had trouble with brewing it and I shared some with my coworker as it was her last day with us today. Initially, I brewed it, and when I added milk, the milk had soured in the cup, and curdled in it, so I decided to ditch it. The water I brought back wasn’t warm enough on the second steep, so it was really weak. Third attempt I used the bags from both of us and heated water from the kettle. this time seemed alright, but I lost track of time at work and may have steeped it too long.So, I don’t think I had a proper cuppa to review, but here’s what I’ll say. It smelled sweet and like honey and chocolate. It was a slightly smoky, but mostly dark chocolate and some honey tones that the sugar and milk brought out.Thanks to Fong Mong for providing me with this sample!I have to say, and be honest, that it tasted a lot like a number of good quality black teas I drink, and in a blind taste test, I’m not sure I could identify each one solely on taste. But this was good, for what I was able to have, and my coworker enjoyed hers too.', '<strong>Free sample provided by Fong Mong Tea-thank you very much</strong>Wow, this is a truly unique tea! I can honestly say I’ve never tasted anything like this.Dry leaves smell sweet and like a combination of fruity and floral. Brewed leaves smell a little malty and a little like some sort of cool mint. The liquor is coppery red.At first, I didn’t taste the mint, and mostly tasted the floral/fruity flavor, but now that my palate picked up on the mint, I mostly taste that along with maltiness from the Assamica. This tea is smooth, sweet, and not bitter at all. It doesn’t fit into any preconceived notions of what a black tea should be-and I like that.I have never tried a Taiwanese black before and I am grateful for the opportunity to have tasted this unusual and flavorful tea.', 'I tried a sample of this and found it very unique for a black tea. Don’t expect this to taste like typical black tea. It’s more like a mix between black and oolong. It’s very complex. The malty, caramel, brown sugar taste of black tea is there, but there’s also vegetal, fruity and floral notes like an oolong. I also tasted some mint and a bit of a medicinal note. I’d recommend trying it for sure, but remember it isn’t a typical black tea and tastes very unique.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Caramel, Chocolate, Cinnamon, Fruity, Malt, Medicinal, Mint, Vegetal\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'The taste…wonderful! You can never go wrong with a decent Sun Moon Lake Black tea. It’s rich and a delight for tea-thirsty mouths. It’s sweet with a slight astringency but nothing that bothers you. Very well balanced! If you like cinnamon flavored black teas, this tea has it naturally. And a quite intense one. I loved it! It offers fruity tones as well. It’s hard to pinpoint but I get a mostly citrusy taste. The mouthfeel is slightly thick and velvety. The aftertaste is quite persistent, particularly the cinnamon taste, and refreshing. It left a nice trail of spicy and fruity flavor both in my throat and mouth.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Cinnamon, Mint, Sweet\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'The wet leaf has the most interesting smell. So much so that I am having trouble being able to put a descriptor to it. Perhaps its hints of eucalyptus in mahogany sawdust in a mixture of compost and wet leaves. It’s such a complex aroma! Somewhat medicinal as well but not in a bad way. A silky mouth feel and dark, clear amber in color. Quite an earthy tea. The aroma carries over into the after taste but the first time the liquid hits your tongue a full force of earthy flavors assault you. I’m not really sure I would say it’s minty like their website describes but it does have that slight mouth clean sensation that mint gives you.', 'Thanks to Fong Mong for this sample. Today we have up a black tea from Taiwan. Ive tried a few black tea’s from Taiwan and usually they are very good.I started by heating the gaiwan, and using about 205 water. I figured I wanted to brew this a little hot and strong to get all the flavors. I get aroma of chocolate, mineral, citrus, and a bit of sweetness from like caramel. The tea liq our is dark red brown, and fairly clear. It has a flavor matching the aroma profile.Second brew I get a bit more spice, possibly nutmeg or allspice. Tiny bit of astringency in this brew as well as a stronger citrus.

Yes, that there be a grape smell.Oh, it tastes just as good as it smells. How can this be? Just when I think all of my socks have been blown off… A bit vegetative/vegetal/planty taste peeking through. I totally skipped the sweetener on this one because it smelled so great I didn’t want to risk ruining it.I wish it would cool down faster. So I can drink it faster.Second steep called for sweetener, as it’s turned more vegetal than the first steep. Like a totally different tea. Hmmm.

This is definite on my order list!! You know a tea is good when crave another cup, and this one I craved!! I was so glad I had enough leaf to make another cup.

While this isn’t quite the pear tea that iv’e been looking for this really does taste, as TB mentions, a pear and a cinnamon jelly belly in my mouth. lol pretty darn delicious!', 'Got this as part of an Ocho Sampler from Joy’s. This has a very well balanced and well blended pear and cinnamon flavor.  Also, the tea base is not overly complex but present and the flavors certainly do not overshadow the tea itself. The pear actually tastes quite natural! Pear is a difficult flavor to get right in my opinion but I feel that this has been blended masterfully so that you get a natural pear essence and not so much that the blend is trying to over compensate or be too upfront.  The aroma is stronger than the flavor itself which I feel is a good thing because usually when you do get a very strong pear flavor it is not all that palatable!  This tea is done right. The cinnamon is not too assertive – either – another flavor component I find often is over done. I am very impressed!  I had this both with and without sugar in the raw – I enjoyed it both ways. I being one with the persistent sweet tooth however liked it a little more with sugar but it was not a startling difference as I only added a touch and that was all it needed!  Would be amazing iced!  Don’t save this one just for the autumn season, pear is delicious any time of year and the cinnamon is not chai like strength. Although again – stronger in aroma than on the palate so don’t let the strong smell worry you!  I have found all too often flavored teas to be on one of two ends of a spectrum – either SO strong and riddled with fake flavorings that you just can’t even drink it unless you don’t mind chemical crud in your tea OR so weak that you strain to savor any flavor at all.  This tea is done perfectly so that you know exactly what flavors you are getting without having to play hide and seek with them yet not so overly done that you gag on it!  Great selection – you should get some!', 'Now this is a good tea. Really good. I don’t tend to like fruity teas, in fact, I generally avoid them. I got this because I needed one more for my ocho sample so I threw this one in. The only way I can describe this is in terms of Jelly beans. But this isn’t an overly sweet tea. Just sweet enough. It tastes as though I have both a juicy pear jelly bean and a cinnamon jelly bean in my mouth. And those happen to be 2 of my 3 favorites (the other being the popcorn jelly bean—anybody found a tea for that one?). I will definitely be re-ordering this. So far I’ve really liked 3 out of 4 of the joy’s teaspoon teas. Not bad!', 'I’m already a huge fan of Joy’s Teaspoon, but this tea puts my devotion over the top!

The cup color tells it; it isn’t that warm orange-gold-brown hue of the sweet potato teas but instead a deeper more burgundy-tinged affair, as I like.

I thought about one of the various wonderful French teas in my cupboard, but decided I had had enough flavored black for one day. I’ve been on a Yunnan kick for a few days now, so I thought I’d look for a highly rated Yunnan I have but hadn’t yet tried.I have tin no. 23 of this limited edition of 150. Inside the tin, long forest green leaves predominate with some lighter blonde colored tips adding visual interest. The dry leaves smell a bit chocolate-y, a deep, dark, rich fragrance.I decided to steep at the average preparation parameters rather than the five minutes at boiling recommended on the tin.I got a clear, dark maple colored liquor with a warm sweet aroma — a bit less sweet than the other yunnans I’ve tried recently but still reminiscent of molasses with some chocolate notes around the edges.The flavor is quite smooth. No back of the throat grab with this one. Medium bodied, and a bit lighter than I’d expected (might try boiling and longer steep next time). The flavor isn’t overly sweet or sugary in the sip, but has some sweetness in the finish and aftertaste. The funny thing is, I can’t really identify a flavor note in this. I can mostly define what I don’t taste. Unlike some yunnans, I’m not getting a peppery flavor, nor am I getting something I’d call malty. There is something bready about it, maybe a rye note, and while the cocoa note in the aroma gets stronger as the tea cools I only taste it a tiny bit. I’m not getting tobacco or cannabis or any of the other things folks have mentioned.Some of the other yunnans I’ve tasted recently have had more depth and complexity, but part of that could be preparation, and a lot of it could also be that my expectations of this one were exceptionally high.

Another gorgeous day filled with a bunch of dolphin pods swimming up and down the coast. I don’t wanna go home!', '<strong>Thank you Stacy for this tea Sample</strong>What a pleasure to have overlooked a Butiki tea sample. How on earth did that ever happen? I look forward to every little bag.  Whatever the reason, it’s been found at the right time.Today I don’t feel good. I’m sure this will pass soon enough.  My weekend was great so I can reflect a good time with my granddaughter Schey! (I forget that I have disabilities and do more than I should at times, especially when the weather is hot. I live in a fantasy world and think I’m in my 40’s!)(or younger!)First we went to Church Sunday morning and then stopped by the H.L. (Happy Luckys) tea shop for a pot of Puerh. This was Scheys first Puerh! I have to say the experience was like ‘Steepster Live’! We were at the bar, the shop was quiet and the servers had been tasting samples I brought in the day before. I was hearing verbal reviews. Schey was giving me her review of the Pu-erh (LOVED IT!), and I was in heaven!I drank more tea later when I arrived back home…and then…I couldn’t sleep till 2 am! I’m trying to set up a blog. No zzzzzzzzz’sI felt ill this morning at 7 am….burned out and not good at all.I saw this little packet from Butiki. Hum.  What was a Guranse? Another one of those high caffeine tea’s that Stacy has?  (I had no idea!)With a good deal of blind faith and trust that whatever was in the packet would be good <strong>because</strong> it came from Butiki, I followed the only information on the label and used boiling water then steeped for 3 minutes.What a shock when I tasted the tea!“Wow, this is good!” I said.(I think in my foggy brain that I half expected an unflavored Guayusa.)This tea was light and sweet with the essence of Freestore Peach and Assam. BUT, without being as dark or malty as an Assam. WAH?…A totally different kind of Black Tea than I’m used to!To compare this tea to a Darjeeling would be a mistake also. There was no acidity or tannin, just smooth and juicy light and fruity tea. (Sounds like a jingle)I let my cup cool. Sipping again and again…trying to reach deep into the soul of this tea. Always the floral sugary peach(could there be a vanilla cream with the peach I am still not committed to that idea as yet)vibrated in my mouth.Guranse has my attention! At no time have I tasted a light Black Tea like this one. I have 4 Black Tea’s from 2 companies that are my favorites and all 4 are FULL BODIED! Very rich and unmistakably distict! My… BONNIE’S TOP BLACK TEA LIST!This little tea slid in under the radar and slapped me awake! I love the subtle beauty of this drippy, succulent, peachy liquor!High Praises Stacy!!! You will hear from me!<strong>Later that same evening…</strong> Tonight I steeped this tea again nice and strong, cut an apple into cubes, heated the apple in the microwave and then poured the tea over the apples to infuse them for a bit. Later, I drained some of the liquid off, added a pat of butter and some brown sugar crystals and popped the apples into the oven next to a breast of chicken that was cooking in a mixture of brewed Butiki Tangerine Creamsicle Guayusa, and bacon. (Yes I’ll have some spinach greens too at the end). Don’t know how this will turn out…going to check on it now… Oh Wow! The Chicken is really good! Um…I think I’m going to have the apples alongside the chicken because they’re soft and mild. The apples in this tea is mild (no spice added).  Perfect with the cream citrus poultry.If I had company over I’d turn the juices into a beautiful glaze and chiffonade some basil and mint over the top. This would be so good with rice. (no apples though) And add artichokes or asparagas.Bye', 'Pair this one with white chocolate and OMG the peach notes SPRING forward!  I love this tea. I choose this for my custom blend from butiki and love the blend as well.  This tea has such wonderful woodsy notes but its light and juicy!  Yes there is a darjeeling quality here yet not quite the same.  Juicy is one word that absolutely comes to mind and not just due to the peach notes but the mouthfeel is very thirst quenching, very liquid-y lol yes tea IS a liquid I know but the way it just slides on the palate like silk is lovely.  The woodys notes are like dried tree bark in flavor – or somewhat of an okay barrel flavor – sort of maple infused.  From reading other’s notes on this tea it seems this is one that remains somewhat mysterious, undecided perhaps, as everyone tends to find similar notes and everyone tends to find some of their own notes.  To me, it is a tea that everyone should have the experience of trying at least once!', 'So good! Delicious malty tone but not quite as heavy as an Assam, I’d say it was somewhere in between Darjeeling and Assam – with flavors that match. There is a woody tone to it that reminds me of a Darjeeling. It is rich and earthy without being too strong. There is a fair amount of astringency, perhaps more than might be expected from a lighter bodied tea. But it is a crisp, tangy astringency, leaving the palate feeling clean and slightly dry. The aftertaste is earthy and a little sweet.A very pleasant afternoon cuppa.', 'Thanks to <strong>Mercuryhime</strong> for this sample! I was a little confused as to what a Guranse was until I read Bonnie’s tasting note a few days ago and then I knew I needed to try it. Teas from Nepal and Darjeeling are among my favorites!I steeped this for 3 minutes in my tetsubin — I still haven’t found anything to replace the glass teapot I broke. One thing you can say for cast iron is it’s very durable and will stand up to a spaz like me.I’m getting a medium orange liquor which is very mellow and smooth. I can definitely sense the malt and a hint of tobacco but there is a delightful fruitiness present as well, lots of peaches! The flavor is mostly sweet with a tiny bit of astringency at the end, but nothing too bothersome. I’m sipping on this plain and it’s yummy, but it could also accommodate a pinch of sugar, if you prefer. I think milk would ruin the delicate flavor here.I certainly wouldn’t mind having this tea around but I have quite a backlog from the region already. :)', 'Another winner from Butiki!  Today was an earlyish day for me, Doctor’s appointment in the morning, and now I’m having some lunch before work. I’m sipping on this from my thermos.I really like teas from Nepal, and this is not an exception. It’s Darjeeling-like without being astringent, very woody and tastes slightly like honey to me. It’s a wee bit on the malty side which is quite welcome today.', 'Okay you guys, I had the <em>brilliant</em> idea to pair my wireless keyboard with the iPad. Hello! The only thing is that my wireless keyboard is Swedish, and therefore has different keys in different places. Thank goodness for muscle memory and knowing where all my punctuation marks are. Mwuahaha.This one was a sample I requested in my latest Butiki order. It brews up a nice medium colour and the scent has that honey sweetness that I love. However, upon my first few sips I feel as though I’m getting the subtlest hint of smoke. Eek. I’m still sipping away though, so perhaps it’s all in my imagination. I’m always thrilled to try new Butikis, but I don’t think this one will make it to my cupboard anytime in the near future.', '<strong>Liberteas</strong> Thanks for this one! I don’t know why it’s taken me so long to try it!I did over infuse this but it’s still sturdy and satisfying! It’s flavor is a combo of un-sweet wood and has a drier type taste and after-taste to it. There is astringency to it but it works well, here! There is a slight bitterness, too, but again, it seems to all work well with the over-all flavor!Different but GOOD.', 'I started typing a mix of guranse and guayusa when trying to pull this up ahaha.

Right, that’s why I’m doing homework in the morning…not looking forward to this test.I thought this had some peppery notes to it, but it really did remind me of Darjeeling minus astringency.

Personally, I’m drawing a lot of waffle-y, sweet, maple and nutty type notes from this one. Having never tried Ho-dduk before I can’t speak to the accuracy, but in addition to those maple and waffle notes I also I get hardcore pecan pie or butter tart vibes from this (and lord knows I love pecans) crossed with kind of Elephant Ear like pastry?

It’s got the sugar and nutty notes from the brown sugar and walnuts fried on the inside. This tea is all types of good. Plus, I left it to cool for a while and the flavors were even more pronounced, which is a nice change of pace because usually ho-dduks are so hot they burn the crap out of your mouth.I’m super pleased with this one and couldn’t have asked for a better custom tea to be made in Steepster’s/my name.

Brioche is awesome, especially with orange marmalade or Apricot preserves…sigh… I make some pretty good things with almond flour, but it is not the same.So this tea…a nice trip down memory lane. Brioche is a very rich bread, loaded with butter &amp; eggs, kind of like Challah (yeah, I used to bake that too). Very airy, with a really nice crust. Sometimes we included raisins, cinnamon, &amp; nuts, &amp; amazingly American Tea Room has captured this nicely. The flavor is rich with a buttery yeasty flavor, with just the right amount of almond, a light dusting of cinnamon, &amp; (I’m probably imagining) a hint of orange peel. I can even taste the crust. Thanks to <strong>TastyBrew</strong> for this trip down Memory Lane.', 'I am so close to a sipdown here, but I must find a way to get more. I love this tea, however infrequently I drink it. It’s just comforting in a delicious, bready way.I ordered 3 oz. last time, but I think 2 oz. may be a safer bet this time around. It’s lost a wee bit of flavour because it takes me an age to drink.', 'Thanks to the darling <strong>Sil</strong> for passing some of the infamous Brioche to me! I’ve been waffling on making an order for over half a year now, not really tempted by their other teas, hence thinking an order wouldn’t be worthwhile. But now I have to chance to see what all the fuss is about.And I get it. The fuss. The dry leaf truly does smell bakery-like. Some bready notes with swirls of spice mixed in. As soon as I started to steep the tea, I picked up a waft of raisin bread, or like a very bready cinnamon bun jewelled with raisins. Actually, it reminds me of my grandma’s babka with a touch of spice.The taste matches the smell, without a doubt. Without any additives, I can taste all of the components I listed above: the eggy bread, the raisins, the spice. This is basically what I hoped Della Terra’s Oatmeal Raisin Cookie would be like, except with more of a bready note.I also appreciate that the liquor isn’t oily or murky from the flavouring. Is it order-worthy? Most definitely. But I’m not sure if I’d give it the title of the Best Dessert Tea, and don’t think it’s worth getting unless you can hit a sale on their site.Speaking of which, ATR does have 20% off sale this weekend so I have the weekend to think about whether I should do it. This is the worst time to have a sale, though! I just told myself to cool it for a while until I get down to, I don’t know, like seventy or less teas again, and not sure if I’m willing to spend $70+ in order to counteract the shipping costs and make it worthwhile. Ho hum.', 'Well. Today’s the day. I now check the 35-40 box. Wow. That seemed so old when I was a kid, but as I still feel like a kid most of the time I’m not gonna think too hard on it :-)I chose this tea as my first tea of the day because it has truly stood the test of time. It was one of the very first loose leaf teas I bought online and is still one of the best. Many short-lived favorites have come and gone, but this one never disappoints. So much like a breakfast pastry, it goes perfect with my breakfast sandwich. A good sweet cup to balance the salty.

It had been on my shopping list forever and I didn’t think I would ever come across it in a store. But voila!! The dry tea bags smell just of Earl Grey. The steeped tea smells not too good. It smells of saffron and black tea, which is not a good combination. I got sad, because I love saffron almost as much as I love Earl Grey. However, the tea totally redeemed itself of first sip. It tasted lovely strong citrous bergamot Earl Grey. You can taste the saffron notes in the background. The saffron makes the tea very smooth, and it makes the citrous “pop”. I am happy this tea tastes much, much better than it smells!', 'I love how Earl Greys are open to interpretation: this one has a bright orange flavor along with a faint base note fragrance of saffron.

Here is the part that freaks me out though: what is in it?! Is it even legal not to list the ingredients? Apparently there is saffron and bergamot (indistinguishable in the flavor).

How do they get away with this?', 'I found this tea at a discount store and decided to take a chance. I don’t believe the claims on the box regarding saffron’s health properties, but the tea itself is delightful.

Worse, lots of people aren’t getting home for Christmas.I wish I could visit each stranded one and give them a cup of this tea.Dry leaves are long and tippy. You know how some Assam smells raisiny? I’m sure I’m catching a faint whiff of smoked pears instead. And Yunnan — God, there must be Yunnan in here. Keemun? Pinch o’ lapsang? All an Imperial secret? Dunno, don’t care. What I can say is this: bright but not astringent, assertive but not a bully, deep but not bitter. Truly a happy-making tea. Restorative. Medium body, thick-to-creamy mouthfeel. My brew is a teensy bit bitter, but only because I steeped it six minutes.And yes, it goes fab with cookies. I noshed a shortbread while sipping.PS For anyone frightened off by my mentioning lapsang, the smokiness is NOT that strong.

I would not be surprised to find out this is heavily yunnan. It’s very similar to Tiger. Which is a good thing! I’m out of Tiger and I liked Tiger. But, I’m not really thinking it’s very holiday.

And I just couldn’t handle that this morning. Thankfully, if there is Darjeeling in this, I can’t tell.There’s no bitterness or tartness – just sweetness and a little cuddle factor, perhaps the suggestion of spices. Not spicy but just something that gives me the idea that this would pair with sugar cookies or snickerdoodles perfectly. The taste is smooth but with a little texture. And yes, it is bright. How it does that without delving into iffy tartness or astringency territory I’ll never know but I like it.If I had to call what was in it, all I could pick out would be Yunnan. It reminds me a lot of the Tiger, though perhaps the Tiger was stouter? Or perhaps I just brewed the Tiger longer. Either way, tasty tea, I am happy I have it!', 'I received this tea several days ago and waited until Christmas Eve Day to give it a try. It came with my very first epic A&amp;D order (I purchased several sets — sigh, I’m gonna miss Select) and I wanted to wait until I had a day to thoroughly enjoy this. I was already adoring the packaging (Geek that I am, plus the spray cans and sparkly snowflake sticker and the cool holiday letter enclosed in the box. Thank you A&amp;D for all the wonderful packaging on top of the well-named teas/company). Oh, and that shiny-shiny sticker? It’s kinda mesmerizing to look at while the tea steeps.Anywho, WOW. I didn’t get to try the Yunnan, but if it’s anywhere near as awesome as this, then damn, am I disappointed that I didn’t get me some before it went away. This is just heavenly. It’s bold with a strong earthiness that I’ve only associated with pu’erhs before. I’m yet to be converted to a pu’erh fan, but for some reason I am truly and deeply digging how rich and earthy this is. It’s like this tea is smirking “all your soul are belong to us” as it sucks my soul.I may be going a bit overboard since I haven’t taken time to brew a proper cup of tea in months (all of it has been at work or on the run), so this reaction may be a bit of a fall-out from 1. controlled tea-brewing conditions, 2. several days off where I get to decompress before getting back to the grind, 3. the warm-fuzzies of the holidays, and 4. having given blood yesterday afternoon.But I do believe that if this were crap tea, then I’d know it.

A lot has changed in my life, and while I could come up with excuses and reasons to tell you, they don’t matter. What matters is that I essentially had lost my way and stopped enjoying the teas I was drinking, it was becoming a game, something to rate and critique to add to my personal list. I had lost the passion and appreciation for the tea that had brought me to this site in the first place.I plan to not do that anymore. I want to slow down and actually enjoy the tea and really experience it instead of just ranking at rating it. I have had many teas in the break, I will go back and experience what I can and rate them appropriately, because I do love doing this, but I had been doing it for the wrong reasons, I am sorry and I plan to rectify this.Whew – now that that is out of the way, I want to say this tea is delicious. Infused hot, no additives, four minutes. Sipped as it cooled there is a delicious black tea flavor in this, it is clean and bright and crisp without being astringent or bitter. The aroma of both the dried leaves and the brewed tea is fantastic, captivating and intriguing. I will be drinking this more often. Thank you for bringing me back.', 'Y’know, I hadn’t quite been feeling the holiday season this year. I’m separated from my family because of finals period, Dan is far away in California, and Ohio weather is pretty morose.

The word repetitively used in reviewing this tea has been “bright,” and I couldn’t agree more. Brews to a beautiful dark rusty color, and I am so pleased to find a black tea I like without milk or sugar. It’s very light as far as black teas go, slightly bitter if left in even a touch too long, with some sweetness particularly noticeable when adding milk etc. The second brew did not hold up very well in my experience, so I’m probably a quarter of my way into the tin! (What can I say? It’s not my fault holiday jingles are in my head! Damn radio.)Where Sampson tastes like bread, this blend tastes more fruity, or snappy.

I have discovered that when it’s warm, my room seems to be one of the hottest in the house. When it’s cold, vice versa. This is what I get for having a room with no windows in it. So since the whether has been decidedly autumny as of late, I’m freezing to bits. Or I would be, had it not been for the fact that I’m under the slanket.Nice hot cup of tea, then. This one, in spite of it being a holiday blend, seems appropriate.Now, is there a cheat sheet somewhere with what the blend is made with? The leaves smell kind of Keemun-y grainy to me. And with a touch of Assam-y raisin notes. After steeping it strikes me as very Keemun-y and with something else that gives it a chocolate-y note. I’m suspecting Fujian in play here, but I’m far from certain. (Notice how my mind works in primarily Chinese blacks? I haven’t even considered the possibility of Ceylon or Kenya in the mix…)I was using the timer for something else when brewing, but I thought I would be able to remember to got and pour before it went off. I wasn’t so it’s had an unknown length of steep but definitely longer than it ought to have been. There is a certain small amount of oversteepedness to the flavour now, astringent but not <em>truly</em> bitter. Actually, to be honest, it’s handling this little mistake admirably.There are <em>definitely</em> Chinese involved here!The astringency comes across here as that pseudo-smoky note which I associate with Keemuns. It’s got a whole lot of flavour this one. I’m very pleased.', 'My mother bought this for me for Christmas! I was so happy! It looks like a small can of paint. The label is super cute and theres a snowflake sticker on the top of the can. I also love the holiday letter that was enclosed. So carefully I opened the tin with the end of a spoon. VOILA! Black slightly curled leaves with small specks of green. Smells slightly smokey and sweet. Love it.Upon steeping, the liquor was a dark golden brown. It reminds me of Yunnan or a milder Keemun. I wish I knew what was in there. There is no hint of bitterness. Delicious! I drank this plain. There was a hint of nuts, sweetness, cream, and slight smokiness to it. Brings back memories to my first Keemun. Very good tea. :)', 'Damn Fine Holiday blend, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways.I love thee in the morning, when I’m trying to wake up.

I always try a tea once before I review it to allow my palette to adjust to the tea. So the first cup was lighter. I didn’t get any smokiness really. It was like an Assam. Then when it cooled there were some honey notes like a Darjeeling maybe. This morning though when I brewed it was all Yunnan. A strong Yunnan black aroma, and on the drive to work. Good morning smokey. Yeah this is a really good blend. I’m bummed I waited to pull the trigger on it before it sold out.', 'Ahhhh…now this is a delightful cup. It’s so smooth and almost a little sweet. I enjoyed a large mug of this while eating my blueberry bagel this morning. They really seemed to go well together. The sweetness of the bagel brought out almost a maple/molasses flavor in the tea. I can taste a very faint smokiness that others have mentioned, but only if I concentrate really hard. I prefer not to concentrate this early in the morning so I am just enjoying a fine cup. Much thanks to oOTeaOo for this sample!', 'A nice, mild black tea blend. No bitterness or astringency.

At first sip my thought was “Fah! I already bought this tea. Damn you Andrews! Damn you Dunham! Damn your pretty labels!” It seemed much too much like their Yunnan. But! Much to my delight there is a kind of fruity twinkly finish that more than distinguishes the Holiday Blend. A very nice black holiday tea (not a tea for depressing morbid holidays, but a black tea for the holidays) for gray snowy afternoons.Additionally, I’m experimenting with cream and sugar for the first time (successfully). It rounds out the bitterness nicely. I’ve tried in the past and always been disappointed, but I’ve always tried with non-fat milk and it seems that you need something a little thicker if you want a more robust flavor.', 'It is raining HARD this lazy Sunday.

I made a single cup of this to test before Wednesday tea party. It is quite good and I took it sans additions. I was only brewing a single cup and I didn’t check to see how many ounces my cup held – it is one I don’t usually use – so I think I made this a little on the weak side. Still, it was good and met my parameters: not bitter, not too astringent, not screaming ASSAM! at me.

I’m generally not one for abstract analysis of the imagery-type variety, but today this tea seems like a perfect reflection of the snow-and-ice-covered world outside: bold and interesting, yet smooth and quiet at the same time. It’s tough to nail down a perfect description though…it’s not smoky like A&amp;D’s Carävan, but there’s maybe a suggestion of it in there somewhere along with a hint of sweetness. I might describe it differently tomorrow, but I do say that it’s quite good and I quite like it.', 'Okay, friends. I’m really trying to contain myself here.This tea is ridiculously good. I’m sensing Keemun, Darjeeling, and something sweeter? Yunnan? It’s smoky in a very smooth way with a sweetness and spice that is hard to describe.

Perfect start to my week!', 'Thanks to Ricky, I now possess a tea by A&amp;D! I’ve been meaning to try their teas for quite some time. I really enjoy this one- it’s a full, rich and dark black blend. Lots of Yunnan flavor, maybe a hint of smokiness. Maybe a touch of Keemun? It also has a subtle sweetness lurking in there. This tea is so rich and smooth, very comforting!! Especially on this frigid day. I don’t usually like to add milk to my teas, but I bet this one would do well with it. I think I’ll try doing that with the next cup! I wish I could cozy up under a blanket with this one!', 'Wow, I finally steeped this correctly today. I’ve been consistently either over-brewing this tea, or putting too few leaves in, or not warming up the cup or pot enough. This tea is a bit fussier than some, for sure, but it’s completely worth it. It’s a bit of a paradox with tea, because that moment when you aren’t yet caffeinated enough to do things right is when you have to figure out how to brew correctly!Also, it goes really, really well with cinnamon sugar coffee cake.', 'Dry leaves smell like muscat.

      "{'Tea Name': 'Honey Orchid Black', 'Tea Ingredients': 'Not available', 'Tea Flavors': 'Cocoa, Honey', 'Tea Reviews': ['I received this one today from Marcus! Thanks!!!I had to jump right in!!! First…I will say that the aroma of the dry leaves smell like a honey-buttered whole wheat bagel I often have from my local coffee shop here. YUM!The color of the liquor after infusing is quite light for a black! WOW! It’s surprising! BUT…it’s NOT light on flavor!I guess the honey comparison comes into play because it IS smooth like honey and it has that natural sweetness of REAL honey…not that fake stuff! I really like the smoothness of this.There is a chewiness to this tea as well…I REALLY REALLY REALLY like that little characteristic!I would say the Orchid/floral connection would be just as you move the sip from the front of your mouth to the back of your mouth right before it ‘goes down the trap’…so to speak! The floral notes are subtle and refreshing in a way I have never tasted before!As this cools it seems to become juicer – I think this is an interesting touch – as well!This tea is more complex than I was expecting and I LOVE that! Marcus wasn’t kidding when he said he’s been putting more thought and stepping up the quality and standards for Golden Moon Teas! WOW!Another thing I noticed with this tea is that the leaves are screaming for a 2nd infusion and I am going to do just that…stay tuned…in the meantime I am LOVING this tea!!! Thanks Marcus!', 'Bumping up because I have been craving this everyday since I had my first cup. Absolutely an amazing cup.Thanks again Marcus!', 'OMG! This is so good.But I’m getting ahead of myself. First, thank you to <strong>TeaEqualsBliss</strong> for sending me some of this tea, and thank you to Marcus from Golden Moon Tea for sending her some of this tea so that she could send me some! And thank you to the tea tree for growing these amazing leaves so that I might partake of this amazing tea.I love this. I absolutely love this. If for some reason I could only have one black tea for the rest of my life, I would probably choose this. Yes, it’s that good.The aroma is amazing, the flavor is sublime. I am mesmerized by how good this tea is. SO GOOD!', 'Oh man, is this YUM.As you all know, I heart Golden Moon. Hard. GM pretty much jump-started my tea education with their sampler (the number one thing I can recommend to ANY tea novice). And now they’re pulling out the big guns, offering fresh and new varietals. Let me tell you, the excitement ensues!Honey Orchid Black is a beautiful tea. When I opened the packet, I nearly squealed at how gorgeous the leaves are. These are <em>huge</em>. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a black tea with such full and gorgeous leaves. It’s kind of gnarled, kind of ancient-looking. Twiggy, leafy, and just full. Expensive-looking as well. This is no CTC. No these leaves look like they were carefully plucked from a tea bush with able, loving hands, and dried with the highest of care.There’s a faintly sweet scent coming off the leaves. And when it comes time to steep this one up, I’m pacing around with excitement. Because as soon as the hot water hits the leaves, a delicious honey-like aroma floods my nostrils. It smells delicious. It smells like clean hay fields and honeyflowers.I don’t think there’s a such thing as a honeyflower.Maybe honeysuckle?ANYWAY, it smells <em>good</em>. Great. Fabulous. And then the timer goes off and it’s time to drink!The first thing I notice is how unusually colored this one is for a black. It looks more roasted-oolong (or an oolong on the darker end of the scale) than black. The color is a deep honey, nothing at all similar to the ambers and dark browns of a lot of black teas. I take the first sip and YES. This is what tea drinking is all about.It tastes less heavy than I expected. This tea doesn’t assault you with its flavor. No, it’s subtle and smart. It coaxes a little smile out of you. It elicits a contented sigh. At the beginning of the sip is a delicious sweetness, honeyed deliciousness mingled with a light black tea flavor. Not at all roasty, and entirely smooth. Then there’s this floral component, a JUICY floral component, similar to the way jasmine has juiciness, but not at all the same flavor. It’s softer. Like gauze. Or gossamer wings. It’s lovely.Then comes the delicious endnote, a whisper of sweetness that lingers and lingers and lingers.It’s great.I can’t wait to see how a second steep will go for this one!', 'First of all, thanks to <strong>threewhales</strong> for sharing this tea with me. This is really awesome! I couldn’t believe the smell of the dry tea: very floral and sweet. After pouring water over the leaves, the honey aroma exploded and I seriously stood over my teapot enjoying the aroma for the entire steep time. This tea is a very rich, honey color, but not at all what you would expect from a black tea. My first sip made me think I was dreaming. This tea couldn’t possibly be that delicious, right?No, actually it is that delicious and perfect. I love this tea. As others have mentioned, this tea is naturally sweet and light. The taste of orchids is present throughout the end of the sip with the honey sweetness taking over at the beginning. I love that there seems to be a texture to this tea, almost biscuit-like yet smooth. This is certainly a treat and I’m looking forward to subsequent infusions.This tea does remind me of the Honey Orchid Phoenix oolong from Tao of Tea, but this tea from GM is MUCH, MUCH better! Wow, I just can’t believe how delicious this is!', 'Whoa~~I have been experimenting w/gong fu blacks, Shangs fermented white tea converted to black, yunnans, keemuns, Ruby Black, and Hawaiian Oolong….. This is the most delightful, naturally sweet black tea I have had yet. This is the first selection in the Golden Moon tea club and I am glad that I joined. Marcus of GM mentioned in the forum about GM’s renewed dedication to quality and I would say that he did not disappoint.', 'Just gorgeous. I’m watching the last episode of Downton Abbey and felt that I needed something a little special to drink this morning. Still on my black kick, I pulled this one out of my treasure chest. A huge thank you to Rachel from Iheartteas.com for sending this to me. I cannot recommend her products and services enough. I love being able to try out so many different teas without purchasing full bags. Please do check out her online shop :)Ok, back to the tea. I love honey. And, I also love orchids. So it seemed to me that this should be a good match for me, right? YES! Most definitely!Dry, this tea is sweet and mouthwatering, and the leaves are really big. Brewed, I was quite surprised at how light coloured the liquor was. Much lighter than I had expected, especially for a black tea. I began to wonder if I messed up the water to tea ratio lol.Once I poured it into my cup, I took another sniff – still honeyed sweetness, but also a very light floral was emanating. Very alluring! To taste, this tea is smooth and light, but still full of flavours – in fact, it is quite complex. On the tongue, I can taste the smooth honeyed notes, and then the floral makes a complementary appearance, finally completing to a smooth, sweet finish. Honestly, the whole experience is a delight! I haven’t even tried adding anything to my cup, as it is beautiful straight.It is a decadent tea that deserves a fine bone china cup, and I’m pleased to have chosen an old Double Warrant stamped Paragaon, decked out gaily in blue and gold. I’m going to finish my pot, and I already have the Golden Moon website open to place an order for more of this fabulous tea.', 'Lowest rating on this one is 84 points! GOSH! This must be some pretty awesome stuff then.I will admit, it had me at the word ‘honey’. If I sweeten my tea at all, which is rare, liquid honey is usually one of my first thoughts. Especially if the tea itself already has a natural honey note to it.Orchid… Not so much. I don’t really do floral. I’ve found some things in which it works, but I’m quite picky about it and it tends to be a detractor for me.So I’m left with a cup of equal parts ‘Oooh!’ and ‘Meh…’ I wonder if it’ll come out neutral, then?I’m sorry to say it does rather. The aroma is all thick honey and delicate flowers, but the flavour is… well… to be honest, it’s a bit weak, really.It’s sort of top-flavoured. Imagine the sip of tea being layered on the tongue. Then the bottom layer is just water, the middle honey and the top tea. And that’s it.Thin and watery, no substance that I can find. Considering the other posts about it, I have to say I’m disappointed. And surprised. How can my experience be so different from theirs? I used plenty of leaf, probably could have steeped it longer, but again, plenty of leaf, so longer than 1 minutes steeping is almost always bound to end badly.As it cools a bit to a more drinkable temperature and the cup develops a little, the orchid comes out more, and it’s reminding me of the floral aspect of the orange pu-erh from Chi of Tea which also has some sort of flower in it. Floral works for me in that one, and now that I’ve found it here, it also works for me here. Surprisingly, considering my troubles with the other flavours of the blend.The honey is putting in a proper appearance here as well, and it doesn’t feel so layered anymore. Or at least, we’re down to two layers. The actual tea itself still keeps to the top layer. It feels a little less weak and thin at this point, but I’m still nowhere near the experience everybody else has had with it.Further development sees the honey and orchid take a step back again and the tea really come out. It tastes like a Chinese or south Indian type with a wooden note and some strong cocoa as well, but then that may just be the flavouring masking the base. I didn’t really find any of these notes in the beginnin when it was so top flavoured.I don’t know… I’m definitely not seeing the same things in this one that others were, so I suppose I’ll have to resign myself to being contrary here and providing the lowest yet amount of points for it.', 'I’ve had this tea for a while, but wasn’t thrilled with it the first time around. Since that first attempt, I’ve learned how to lightly brew my black teas, which has resulted in a much more favorable outcome. Case in point, Honey Orchid Black.The dry leaves smell lightly like pepper. They’re very long and light and it’s hard to get them measured unless you have a scale. I’ve been using 3g per 6 oz. of water. 195/1 min.Now, the tea smells lightly of tobacco. I’m not certain where that’s coming from as I expected more of a sweet floral scent as per the name. The taste is lovely. It’s lightly sweet, yes, there is a hint of tobacco in the flavor, but there’s an aftertaste of something floral. Overall, it melds together quite well and I’ve enjoyed several steeps of this one, all of them very pleasant.', 'Definite notes of Laoshan black!

This tea has both cacao nibs and shells…the shells combating the slightly sour taste that comes with cacao nibs. The base tea in Red Cloud is from Hunan China, which is I think what makes this tea work as well as it does. Canton’s Chocolate tea is assam/chinese and is steeped for only 3 minutes. This tea, because it can be steeped longer (gotta love Chinese teas!) imparts more of the chocolate flavor from the shells and nibs…which is good/bad….good, because there’s more natural chocolate flavor…bad because it overwhelms the vanilla and you kind of lose it in the mix.

I don’t have the expertise to define exactly what makes this wonderful tea from Whispering Pines so magnificent, but it is certainly the finest cup of tea I’ve ever tasted. I realize that it sounds as though I’m heaping a ton of hyperbole into this review; please believe me – this tea is exceptional and deserves all the praise I’m throwing at it.Disclosure: I am a huge fan of jasmine in tea. If you are not, this may not be a flavor profile you would love. I appreciate the scent of both tea and jasmine – having both fragrances surround me just enhances the taste of both for me when a truly great black or oolong tea base is accompanied by the addition of natural jasmine blossoms. (I can skip the jasmine green teas – they usually don’t excite me). With Alice, WP has introduced the ultimate in sensory overload for those of us who love the taste of a truly fine tea coupled with the fragrance of jasmine.Using Golden Snail Black Tea as the base, I didn’t expect to fall in love. I am a fan of oolongs and have never fully appreciated black teas. I have been converted!When I discovered Whispering Pines, I think Alice had just made its debut as one of his offerings. I ordered an ounce of it along with several other of his great teas and began enjoying each one in sequence until I opened and tried Alice. This batch was apparently limited in the amount crafted and offered – it was already Out of Stock when I jumped online to order more!!! I am on the waiting list for notification once more is available and I will definitely be purchasing much more than my first measly one-ounce supply – I am rationing myself in the hopes of replenishing my stock before it’s totally gone.Someone on another site mentioned that they also loved Alice but found it to be too expensive for everyday enjoyment – I strongly disagree. Less expensive tea that isn’t all that interesting is VERY costly, especially if you have to force yourself to drink it just to make it go away. I can’t afford a lot of things, but well-crafted, fine quality tea is an affordable luxury, IMHO.', 'Brenden, you magnificent son of a bitch. You really did it with this one.I remember specifically having tea with Brenden and listening to him talk about the field of jasmine he rode past on his bike and how it triggered this whole adventure of his into blending.

It takes two of my favorite things in tea, a glorious golden snail tea and the scent of a high quality jasmine, and blends them beautifully.

This is my favourite black jasmine of all that I have tried, the taste of this tea is pleasant in all areas of the mouth and the aftertaste is an enjoyable continuation of all components of the warm and sweet flavours without the traditional dry mouth astringency that usually accompanies black jasmine teas.

Thanks Stacy for letting me try this one!', '<strong>Thank you Stacy for this sample</strong>Stacy told me that this has been her favorite morning tea of late so when I had my choice of samples with my last order, I picked this one to enjoy! Her selecton of organic, high quality rare tea’s has me coming back for more.<strong>This is an orthodox tea from a small farm in Kenya and part of the proceeds from sales go the promotion of Tea’s for Trees. Hooray!</strong>The dry leaves look like the tangled main of a lion…all golden shades of various browns and blond hair wrapped and twisted elegantly askew. They smell dry like softest vanilla.The wet leaves puff up into large brown ochre fellows, sweet smelling and reminiscent of bergamot.The taste was like a walk through the tea plantation…the scent and flavor of sweet bosc pear then golden walnut and gentle not-too-malty tea underneath which was golden and sunny in character. There was a slight heat on my tongue that lasted long after my cup was empty and which I found to be a lovely lingering reminder of just how good this tea had been.  There was a comment from Stacy about a cocoa note. I had been trying to discover that flavor but found it to be elusive this time around. I tried the tea sweet which was very nice. Without additions the tea was sweet and delicious enough. I would not add milk.I can see why Stacy loves this tea to begin her day. Not everyone likes the heavy Assams or stronger black tea’s. This is the perfect choice for a more moderate full flavored tea without big malt and smoke but a bit of fruity flavor and nuttiness. Super delicious!', 'This sample was provided by Butiki in my last order – thanks for the sample. :)These leaves are so long and slender with beautiful brown and golden colors. My wet leaves smell slightly sweet of cocoa and malt! I don’t believe I’ve had a kenyan tea before so I’m a bit excited.This was steeped via regular infusion mug method and is quite surprising. The color is a dark orange and the flavor is yummy, like roasted sweet potatoes or carrots – it reminds me of a golden monkey type of tea. I am also getting a lot of walnut in the cup and a tiny touch of oak. The fruity aroma of this tea reminds me slightly of a darjeeling and the flavor is very clean with a rich mouthfeel. AhhhhhNormally with black tea I’m tempted to dump soymilk in, but this is delicious plain. This would be a great afternoon tea – Super relaxing. I really enjoyed this!', 'This is another one of my favorites from Butiki. I was really intrigued with the fact that this is from Kenya, it’s something totally new to me and it’s very cool that I was able to try it.First of all, I must say that the dry leaf is absolutely gorgeous.It is composed of large, twisted and evenly graded leaves. There’s a lot of consistency in the size of the leaves and not much dust or fragments. The color of the leaf is about half dark cocoa and half golden, and the golden portions have a sort of fuzzy appearance. And when you look at the leaves in a pile they seem very “fluffy”. I don’t know, I’m just a sucker for the visual appeal of golden-tipped teas.As for flavor, this tea is EXTREMELY unique compared to other black teas I’ve had. It’s actually very hard to put into words but the best I can come up with is notes of oak and other fragrant wood, along with a slight fruitiness and very slight cocoa notes. There is absolutely no bitterness or harshness to this tea, it is very smooth and drinkable.My description doesn’t do this wonderful tea justice, it’s really something you need to try for yourself, and I would highly recommend trying it. I know that it was a new experience for me.', 'Trying to get through a few more of my straight Butiki teas before the contest closes (I really should get on posting these on Facebook and submitting things…) Anyhow, I could have sworn I had tried this tea before, but a) there was no tasting note on it and b) my tea spreadsheet (which is horribly out of date) said I hadn’t drank this one. So, they’re probably right. And, this was confirmed when I opened this bag of tea and was blown away by the sweetness emanating from the bag! Completely unexpected! All of a sudden I was much more interested in trying this tea.This is one of the smoothest non-chocolatey blacks I have ever drank! It tastes kind of like a standard black tea, but with a delicious sweetness and absolutely none of the astringency I usually find in black teas. The flavour is light but full-bodied, with a thick, silky mouthfeel. This is really quite delicious! It’s probably not a tea I’d pick up again, as I don’t typically drink a lot of straight blacks, but I would definitely drink it again happily!ETA: Yum! Second infusion is lighter but tasty!', 'Oooh, <strong>Kittenna</strong> sent me another tea on my shopping list! Woot!! And this is my first Butiki tea; I’m so excited! I feel like I say that about every tea. Tea tasting is just a bundle of excitement for me, what can I say?The leaves are really neat looking. Tightly twisted, spindly, curled black and gold leaves. Time to brew it up and see what it tastes like!Wow, this brewed up really light! It’s a very light golden color. I haven’t liked Kenyan teas in the past, but this one is different. It does have that slight aroma and taste that I don’t know how to describe but that I recognize as Kenyan. But it’s not off-putting like I usually find it. It’s good!Like the liquor color, the taste is light. That’s not to say flavorless. There’s lots of flavor. It’s just a light, subdued cup of tea with mild astringency. No bitterness though. The description says cocoa and milk chocolate notes. I’m not getting any of those. I can imagine a pear undertone, but I’m not sure how much is truly in the cup vs in my imagination.The second steep for 4.5 minutes brewed up much darker. Now it’s a reddish amber color. The flavor is pretty much the same, except maybe a bit less astringent. I’m not overwhelmed by awesomeness, but this was a fun tea to try. Thanks again <strong>Kittenna</strong> for sending me a sample!', 'Lions and Tigers and Tea! Thank you <b>Stacy</b> for sending this downy and delicious sample!This one brews up into the most fascinating golden color, as if Apollo’s tears of joy at the taste had been collected in my cup! The base nuttiness woven with sweet pear makes for an understated but complex taste. In the mouth both flavors sit tightly together to form a dark cacao-ish hint of a profile but once the whisper of it is all that remains in your throat, the pieces melt into distinct and separate entities. There is a starchy (not in a bad way) mouthfeel that tells you up front this will be different and lingers slightly after each sip – moving your cup holding hand by divine intervention repeatedly toward your lips!

I patiently watched as <strong>Courtney</strong> picked up the bag of tea from the shelf, peeled open the gold flaps of the bag, shook it and took a big whiff. She looked at me and told me that – after months of trying <em>real</em> teas – that I could finally have a cup of TWMB.I am not sure if it was the sweetness of the initial first breath that I took as I held the mug close to my mouth for the first sip, or the way she stared me down to make sure that I would lick the mug clean, but I instantaneously knew that this was a <em>very</em> special tea. She informed me that this particular occasion was very significant because this would be the last cup of this tea – one of her favourites! I felt honoured and made sure to savour in every last drop. Needless to say, it was a phenomenally smooth and pleasantly sweet cup of tea that satisfied every expectation that one could have.While still attempting to recover from the loss of the original TWMB, <strong>Courtney</strong> stumbled upon this tea, which we ordered immediately and retrieved from the post only hours after its delivery. We made our first cup of this tea tonite and the verdict is in, folks – we love it! It is the reincarnated version of TWMB! I foresee this being a permanent staple tea in our cupboards and on our shelves!I want to thank you for reading my lengthly first tea note.  I hope your tea was warm and your chair was comfortable.', '<strong>whatshesaid</strong> wrote such an enticing note for TTC that I decided to order a few black tea samples for <strong>Alexa</strong> and I. We rescued the teas from the post yesterday and had all intentions of drinking this one last night, but ended up having it tonight instead.I <em>so</em> wish I still had a wee bit of TWMB to compare, because I think this is it.

Without Steepster, and all of you tea lovers posting your awesome reviews encouraging me to try and buy more more more (and also, thanks in general to the internet, for feeding this habit by bringing everything that much closer to me)… I never would have discovered this tea. Or TTC.Because honestly.Last night I decided to make a mug of this, I had purchased 5 samples from TTC and recently got them. I am practically on a tea hiatus at this point, i mean i certainly SHOULD be. But I’d had a TTC sample once upon a time and knew that down the road more would be mine, all mine.So when I cut open my adorably patterned sample bag, I stuck my nose in and inhaled like breathing was going to go out of style and OMG. The scent. INTOXICATING. I don’t even know. So good. I can’t describe.And then I brewed it up, took my first sip, and it was like happiness exploded all over my tongue. It’s fruity and malty and bready and fresh and bright and SO FLAVOURFUL.I don’t ever want to live without this tea.I really need to start drinking down everything I have to reach a point where I only stock my absolute loves.

Except for you guys.Everyone who hasn’t tried this tea must wishlist it immediately :) You’re welcome. Trust me.(PS – I spent like 2 hours just slowly and enjoyably organizing my tea stash yesterday. Of course my online cupboard isn’t really up to date yet, but physically arranging and mentally taking stock of all of my teas (ALL OF THE TEAS) was incredibly calming and satisfying.)', 'Today my order from Taiwan Tea Crafts arrived, after a long delay. I have been excited to try a Yuchi wild mountain black tea for a very long time and now I can! I cannot say I’m disappointed. From the first smell of the dried leaves to the first sip I’m completely blown away. Those little leaf-hoppers are the unsung hero of the hour!The initial smell is, I kid you not, cinnamon rolls. This tea smells exactly like walking by the cinnamon roll stand in the mall, only better. I opened the package and immediately told my wife “you must smell this, now!” She didn’t, because she was too busy drinking some other tea and didn’t want to ‘ruin that experience’. News-flash, drinking this tea ruins all subsequent tea drinking experiences.I weighed out 4 grams and poured 240 ml of boiling water over the leaves and immediately, again, the smell hits me from the tea pot, candy apples, cinnamon, unicorn tears, who knows, it is just glorious. Those 4 minutes cannot go by fast enough!I pour the tea, I’m busy signing into Steepster to get this review ready, my wife tastes it first, her face lights up, “You need to try this now!” The taste is ineffable. So unbelievably good. There is cinnamon, wine, apple, candy, brown sugar, caramel, no bitterness, no astringency, other flavours that I cannot even put my tongue upon.I will literally move Taiwanese mountains to find a supply of this tea to sell. Nothing comes close, all other teas should just pack up their leaves and go back to tea-island because this tea, hands down, unequivocally, and I say this without compunction, kicks the absolute fucking crap out of every single other tea that I have drank. I’m at the bottom of my cup now, and it is really, really sad because it had to end, and I knew it had to end when I began. My wife is smelling her empty cup because it smells good, make another infusion god-dammit!I can honestly say that none of this is hyperbole.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Apple Candy, Baked Bread, Caramel, Cinnamon, Honey, Red Wine, Sweet\\n</div>'], 'Polarity': [0.20138888888888892, 0.22630685286935287, 0.11333333333333333, 0.2170001102292769, 0.20606060606060606, 0.28721724971724977, 0.04473945279866333], 'Mouthfeel': '', 'Flavor Profile': {'Spicy': 0.625, 'Char': 0.0, 'Sweet': 0.3125, 'Nutty': 0.0625, 'Floral': 0.0, 'Herbs': 0.0, 'Vegetables': 0.0, 'Grass': 0.0, 'Wood': 0.0, 'Earth': 0.0, 'Mineral': 0.0, 'Marine': 0.0, 'Berry': 0.0, 'Citrus': 0.0, 'Tree Fruit': 0.0, 'Tropical': 0.0}}\n",

The aroma of tropical fruit, lychee, flowers, peaches. The color is very satisfying: deep amber.The taste is quite mild and largely follows the nose. I somehow expected a bolder taste. Make sure not oversteep it since it acquires the rougher bitterness that crowds out milder floral notes. In the third steeping and later the floral notes are largely replaced with apricot, honey, and almond.It is a very forgiving tea and comes out well in a gaiwan, grandpa style or the typical western method. I came to like it as a daily drinker because what eslse do you need for that but a tea that fragrant, good tasting, not harsh and goes well with almost any kind of mood? It has been growing on me steadily.I will add it to the beloved keemun hao ya as my daily staple. It has the same robustness and is perfect as a morning tea.

I was never disappointed. I always loved every track on every album.During the last six years, I have grown to have the same confidence in teas by Teavivre. I’ve tried a lot of their teas and I don’t remember ever being disappointed. So, for the first time, I actually bought a pound of this Yunnan Gongfu Fragrant Black Tea without seeing, smelling, or tasting it. My wife expressed skepticism and astonishment when I told her I sent our hard earned money all the way to China for a whole pound of a product I never even sampled! I gently assured my more sensible half that she need not worry. I know what I’m doing (I hope).When the pound arrived, it was shipped and packaged in five 3.5-ounce silver zip bags. So, it is in reality a total of 17.5 ounces- more than a pound. I decided not to convey this fact to my sweet spouse just yet.After consolidating the five bags into one tall metal container, I noticed the sweet and fragrant aroma (hence its name) of the long black leaves with golden accompaniments. The smell was like honey and chocolate.I steeped the leaves for five minutes at 195 degrees. These settings were within Teavivre’s recommended brewing range. The resulting liquor was a deep amber color. The aroma was sweet like honey.As I hopefully and optimistically took my first small sips, my palate was flooded with the sensations of honey and chocolate. These flavors were perfectly blended and the entire experience was smooth as silk with no astringency lurking under the covers. Through my entire first and second cups, the very pleasant tastes remained consistent, smooth, and steady. The aftertaste was light and amiable. It seemed to softly dangle on my tongue until it tenderly dissipated.I am very pleased (and relieved) to report that this is another exquisite tea from the folks at Teavivre which I highly recommend. If you like sweet, smooth, and full-bodied black teas (and who doesn’t?), you will love this one.

The scent is malt and honey with a hint of chocolate, and the taste is similar – it’s always nice to find a tea that lives up to its scent! The initial sip is brown sugar and malt, but a dark chocolate flavour develops in the mid-sip and lingers nicely. It’s super-smooth, with absolutely no bitterness or astringency. I’ll be resteeping this one!', 'Here’s Hoping TTBWhat a fantastic start to my tea box sampling adventure!

Gave the leaf a quick rinse. Followed the website’s instructions: 5 seconds, 7, 9, 12, 18, 28, 28, etc.Not only is the leaf richly aromatic all around, but the aroma is intriguingly complex. The dry leaf has notes of molasses, brown, sugar, sweet potato, and a bit of malt. Sitting in the pre-heated gaiwan, the leaf aroma then becomes sour and sweet – like raisins and cranberries – and also has a fragrance of freshly baked bread. The wet leaf aroma is similar, smelling of fresh cranberry muffins.The liquor is bright golden-orange, clear, and medium-bodied. While the aroma of the Dian Hong is complex, the taste is much simpler. The flavors do evolve with a gongfu session, but each infusion yields an uncomplicated brew. The first cup is light in flavor, with the sour cranberry note making an appearance. Beginning with the second cup, the flavors are more developed. The second tastes purely of sweet potato. The third and fourth are creamy in texture, bread-like, woody, and sweet potato-like. With cups five through seven, the flavors undergo a drastic change. This Dian Hong shifts from classic sweet potato to a sweet/fruity hongcha. The aftertaste, throughout the session, is very short-lived.I recommend this to hongcha/Dian Hong lovers and especially beginners to hongcha. As someone who probably appreciates aroma more than taste, I loved this. But since I also evaluate taste by similar weight, I found this to be alright – not spectacular. It’s easy-going. I did enjoy what I had, though I wouldn’t purchase.

However, I should have noticed the ‘gongfu’ in the name and realized that was where the magic would be. I don’t steep teas with the gongfu method, I use the western method. I’m sure this one would taste much different using gongfu. All of those wonderful reviews from others sure set the expectations high! The leaves here are very large and twisted with hints of gold. The dried leaves have the scent of lovely dried hay. The flavor is neither a light yunnan or a dark yunnan. It’s somewhere in the middle. The flavors are tough to describe, mostly bittersweet chocolate with hints of wine. I guess I like a honey Yunnan or a deep dark chocolate Yunnan. This one is in between both of those flavor profiles, so isn’t as special to me as other teas (again, probably because I’m not using the gongfu method of steeping.)

It smells absolutely amazing while brewing…I almost didn’t want to wait for it to finish.I liked this one a bit better than the one by adagio teas. The adagio one had more of a peppermint taste, but this one blended nicely with the taste of cinnamon. Again, I wouldnt say that it overwhelmingly tasted like candy cane, but still…it was amazing and reminded me of Christmas time. I would definitely add permanently to my collection.', 'I picked this up as part of my haul at the ottawa tea festival today, and decided it would be my first cup!I was so intrigued by the smell of this (like mint mixed with hot cinnamon hearts), but was a bit worried about how it would taste. I did notice the leaves were larger than what I’m used to (as a tea newbie most of my teas come from David’s tea).I’m happy to say this tea delivered! It was frankly one of the best black teas I’ve ever had. It was smooth and minty, and surprisingly not spicy like it smells. I’m very excited to try the other tea I bought from here, and to visit this shop as soon as i can justify it!!'], 'Polarity': [0.23214285714285715, 0.2921666666666667, 0.26462673611111115], 'Mouthfeel': '', 'Flavor Profile': {'Spicy': 0.6666666666666666, 'Char': 0.0, 'Sweet': 0.26666666666666666, 'Nutty': 0.06666666666666667, 'Floral': 0.0, 'Herbs': 0.0, 'Vegetables': 0.0, 'Grass': 0.0, 'Wood': 0.0, 'Earth': 0.0, 'Mineral': 0.0, 'Marine': 0.0, 'Berry': 0.0, 'Citrus': 0.0, 'Tree Fruit': 0.0, 'Tropical': 0.0}}\n",
      "{'Tea Name': 'Taiwan Oolong Black Tea', 'Tea Ingredients': 'Not available', 'Tea Flavors': '<dd class=\"empty\">Not available', 'Tea Reviews': ['This is a sipdown of the sample I received from <strong>Nuvola</strong> a while back.I had a bit of a stressful weekend so far. A truly toxic person is trying to get me involved in her dramas, I had a lot of tedious work to do that I wasn’t looking forward to, and we have some decisions to make that I just wish would go away, preferably because we won the lottery and were Elvis-rich and then I would fly to Nevada Hospital and make tea for GMathis and surf teh interwebs with her. I would bring Samwise and say he was a therapy dog and we would dance with him in the waiting room. (Can you tell I need an ESCAPE???)I took a break from my cleaning and had a cup of sanity and some Bissinger’s Chocolates. Honey, if tea and chocolate don’t make it better, you need to get in somebody’s LAP!I had forgotten that this black tea steeps up rather light, but it surely was good. The taste is very fruity and complex. It went quite nicely with the chocolate even though it wasn’t as powerful as the Keemuns I usually drink with sweets. Instead of cleansing the palate for the next tidbit like my usual choices do, this sort of sidled up to the chocolate and made friends. There was a hint of roastiness for a low note, lots of middle fruity notes playing along, and a high note of sweetness singing over it all.This is a really nice tea and not “run of the mill.” I think it would be great to have hanging around!', 'My first thought when I picked this tea to try was “Oooh, black oolong. Now this is interesting.” Honestly, as long as I’ve been here at Steepster, I had somehow never heard of such a thing. I ripped open the little packet and inspected the leaves. Dark and thin, rolled into long narrow strips. It looked like a fine black tea with a few hints of golden brown here and there.I treated this one gently as well, and may or may not have used a bit too much water in my ceramic teapot. The liquor is a pale tan, and smells like black tea with a hint of sweet fruit. The taste is very, very interesting. While it does have hints of floral, spring-like oolong, I can taste the black tea oxidization more. It’s caramelly and much more robust than a traditional oolong. Malty, even. Like a light golden tip tea… sort of. This is hard to describe and delightfully complex, and I love it.Also, after checking the website to see how much this tea is, it’s listed as $60HK for 50g… I was horrified at how expensive it is. But then I checked a converter on Google. It’s only about $8 USD. Whew!', 'It’s been a week since I received this sample and I’ve only just now got around to drinking it. I was feeling a little under the weather when I got it, and I didn’t think those were the best conditions to have it in, having promised to do my best with it. And now a week has gone by and I still haven’t got to it. I was beginning to feel a little guilty about it, so I decided that today was The Day, especially as it would come in handy as a pick-me-up after the c25k torture of the day. (Horrid today! Horrid! A marked difference from Friday which was a 3.2 km running, no walking, powering through <em>triumph!</em> But horrid today.)Nuvola Tea approached me by email, asking whether I would be interested in receiving a free sample and posting about it. That’s the first time I’ve been approached with such an offer, so it felt rather special to me for them to do so. Like my opinion mattered. Kind of flattering and humbling all at the same time. I know some of you others have tried this several times, so you probably know what I mean. After having asked a couple of questions, I eventually agreed and promised to do my best. So this is it.I don’t normally pay any attention to recommended parameters. Water temperature, yes, leaf amount and steeping time, no. I know which strength I prefer my teas to have and which length of steeping normally produces the best cup for me. The person who wrote out the recommendations may not share my particular preferences, and so tea brewing becomes every bit as subjective as the actual flavour experience itself. So most often I go by my own experiences first. If that doesn’t work, then I might start looking at instructions and get some inspiration that way.With this particular tea I thought I owed it to Nuvola Tea to try and follow their instructions as closely as I could, since they were providing the leaf for free in order for me to post about it for them, and there only being enough for the one go. As it turns out, though, I do actually still get to do it my way, as these instructions fit pretty closely into the procedure I was planning on following as mentioned above. I would have have made the steeps a wee bit longer initially, but the difference here is fairly small, so I might as well follow theirs. Coming that close to their instructions based only on my own experience and educated guesswork makes me feel all validated and smart!Now, when I received the sample there was also a leaflet included which showed a table of the different teas Nuvola offers, sorted according to strength and degree of oxidation, with a small one sentence description of each. That was pretty inspiring. I found a couple more things in that table which I would like to try at one point, and at least one of them was a tea that I don’t think I would have otherwise even looked at.More importantly for me, however, the leaflet also has a map of Taiwan with the origin of each tea is drawn in. I love that! I love knowing where a tea comes from in slightly more detail than just ‘Taiwan’ or ‘Sri Lanka’ or whichever tea producing country you can think of. There will be differences even within the same country and that makes for half the fun of exploring a region. This particular tea was produced right in the middle of the islandOkay, enough with the introductory chatter. <strong>The actual tasting begins here.</strong>So now, <strong>the first steep</strong> was given 30 seconds as according to Nuvola’s oolong brewing recommendations, because in spite of all intentions to do my best, I still managed to botch the temperature. It has a very sweet aroma, quite caramel-y, and with just a smidge of something kind of floral waaaay in the background. It mostly cararmel. Actually it rather reminds me of that Jade Orchid Oolong that I liked from Shang Tea. The one that tasted like creme brulee! Could this actually be something similiar to that? It would be awesome if it were!The initial flavour I’m getting is a something mineral, but it’s fleeting and quickly gives way to a mixture of floral and caramel. This is indeed caramel-y. If I didn’t know any betting I might have thought it had been flavoured. There are some slightly dry-ish cocoa-y notes as well but they seem to stay mainly on the edges of the flavour, letting the caramel really take the lead.To tie off the comparison with the Jade Orchid Oolong from Shang Tea, yeah, this really does remind me a lot of how I remember that one to be. All sweet and dessert-y.For <strong>the second steep</strong> I made sure to go by the recommendations for a black tea rather than an oolong. All this really entailed at this point, was giving the temperature a notch upwards, but the steeping time was the same. This time the caramel note has stepped back a bit and the cocoa-y note is coming more into the mix. The primary note, though, is nother caramel nor cocoa but something vaguely fruity. I can’t tell which sort of fruity, but I think it seems most like some kind of stone-fruit, like nectarines or apricots. There’s a slightly floral top note here as well.Again, there is a fleeting note of mineral and then it’s gone all fruity! It’s definitely a stone-fruit, I think. Plums! In the background the mixture of caramel and cocoa-y-ness, which provides a sweet and smooth aftertaste. Like just having eaten caramel-flavoured sweets.Hey, this is going rather well in spite of my initial confusion!<strong>The third steep</strong> combines tea drinking with one of my favourite things in the world: Being sat on by a cat. Especially one of mine as they are so adorably cute and they <em>purr!</em> I just have to be really careful not to spill hot tea on her. The aroma of which has now taken on a wooden sort of oolong-y note (oh, and now my cat went away. Boo. I can’t compete with the lure of the water bowl apparently) with cocoa and that same fruity, plum-y note underneath. No caramel at this point.The flavour is the same as the aroma. AGAIN that one fleeting flavour of minerals, which is odd, actually because it’s always there in the first sip, but <em>only</em> the first sip. I don’t get the logic of that, really. Perhaps it has something to do with temperature or something. Anyway, after that initial misleading sip, the flavour is largely fruity and cocoa-y-wood-y. There is still a wee bit of caramel left, but only on the aftertaste. Something tells me I’ve seen the last of that caramel at this point.<strong>The fourth steep</strong> is had after a few hours break with a puzzle (and a cat halping me). I do loves me a good puzzle, but they never seem to last long enough. I’ve got one 4000 pieces one which I’ve taken out now. That ought to keep me entertained for a while, but I’ve only done it once before and it’s quite difficult, so here I am for a bit of liquid courage. It took a month the first time around! O.O Not sure what I’ll do with it in regards to hoovering, but I’m sure I’ll think of something.Anyway, my liquid courage has an aroma that is very much like the one in the third steep and therefore shan’t be commented further upon. The flavour is all smooth and slightly cake-y, and to my surprise the caramel bottom note is there again as strong as ever. It was just that the other notes were covering it up some before. Those have receded, though, so I’ve got caramel-y smoothness which even tastes ever so slightly thick and milky. That’s funny, I was certain the caramel note was finished.<strong>The fifth steep</strong> seems to be the last. For one thing, I’m running out of day. For another thing, I’m also apparently running out of flavour. It’s still quite caramel-y, but that’s the only flavour note left to me. Maybe if I had increased the steeping time more than I did it would have been a different result, but I didn’t.In that event, I shall pee, post, have dinner, watch <em>The Pirates</em> and go to bed. In that order.', '<strong>Thank you to Nuvola for this Oolong Black Tea sample!</strong>I was suffering from the beginnings of a migraine today, the nausea felt like vertigo making me dizzy. In my bag was this sample which I had promised to share with Joe at Happy Lucky’s yesterday. I told him about the tea trees being at 9000 ft. in the mountains of Taiwan. What an adventure it would be to taste the tea and discuss the flavor together.A stop to get a light for my refrigerator and another at the Post Office were challenging. Would I be able to make it to tea? (My car’s outdoor temperature gauge recorded 95 degrees, still hot and dry for September.)“It’s just nausea, push through it. Caffeine will be good for the migraine anyway,” I told myself. So off I went to my tea pub.When I arrived today, there was a buzz of people in front of the bar and behind it (including Joe). There was the owner George in his bermuda shorts, fiddling with some tea things…greeting me with a big “Hi Bonnie, how’re ya doin?”I explained that I had a little migraine and needed caffeine, but that I had brought some Taiwan Oolong Black Tea grown at a high altitude that I wanted to share.What happened next was <strong>Tea Theatre!</strong>A flash of cups, a Gaiwan…six people lined up on barstools and several servers behind the bar as George deftly worked his magic. Pourings, scenting, tastings for everyone…steep after steep, after steep…on and on at least 6-7 times. I lost count.The interesting thing was that from the beginning, the tea was potent. There was no need to work up to a 3rd or 4th steeping to gain the full flavor of this tea. The taste was assertive as though all the hard work the trees had to go through to produce the leaves at the high altitude was condensed and released like golden pearls. The flavor released easily from the leaves.Comments flew around me…“Dark Cherry”, “Malty”, Chocolate\", Wonderful lingering flavor\", “Rich and complex”.My own notes were:  I felt a coolness on my tongue (which the others felt on the lingering finish also). There was a nuttiness and flavor somewhat like tutti frutti (brandy, sugar and many kinds of fruit placed in a crock and stirred…an old recipe for preserving fruit). A floral scent from a musky flower.The color of the tea was honey from beginning to end and very fragrant. The leaves reminded me of smoky, malty Formosa Red (Red Blossom Tea) that I reviewed before (although this came up only when I was reminded of this tea by Joe).And…my nausea…gone. The caffeine did what it is supposed to do and helped take the effects of the migraine away!I can’t think of a better way to have experienced this tea than with this community of tea lovers.I had a great time with a very lovely rich and flavorful tea!', 'Thank you <strong>Nuvola Tea</strong> for this delicious and unique sample!What a great idea of offering this very intriguing black tea. It’s always nice to find a good Taiwanese tea, especially a oolong or black – but find a hybrid, now that’s absolutely perfect!The really long dark strips of tea leaves are more like an oolong, but they are more oxidized to the range of black tea. The taste is sensationally sweet, with some roasted fruity peach notes. The liquid has a pleasant medium fullness with a faint maltiness toward the end of the sip.This tea is another great reason to love Taiwan teas! Thankfully companies like <strong>Nuvola Tea</strong> see the need to expose the Western culture to this great treasure. What a privilege it is to experience the long history &amp; tradition of other cultures that celebrate good tea. Definitely a great cup!', 'This is tasty tea. It’s very sophisticated compared to all the flavored things I’ve been drinking. :) I was a bit confused by how this is both an oolong and a black tea, but after my first few sips, I’ve concluded that this is merely what I would call a dark oolong, something more oxidized but still lighter than what I would think of as black tea.I really like the mouthfeel on this one. Smooth and full. It has a luscious quality to it. The flavor here is pleasantly floral, but only a little. Just enough to make you intrigued. Only lightly roasted. Mellow.I’m finishing up my third steep made western style. There’s a lovely natural sweetness here. It can probably go once more but I need something different now. :)', 'Thank you to <strong>Nuvola Tea</strong> for this sample!  Nuovla Tea always impresses me!  After the new year this is one of the companies I plan to make a good order with!  Here are some snippets from my upcoming review (scheduled at this time for December 24th on <a href=\"http://sororiteasisters.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://sororiteasisters.com/</a> )Premium Taiwan Oolong Black from Nuvola Tea has a sinful aroma! It smells sweet, deep, intoxicating. There is a malty aroma cutting through the sweet aroma, then nutty, woodsy, so many wonderful sensations – and this is just the initial smell!I love the complexity of this tea! On one hand its sweet and makes me feel like Willy Wonka in a candy shop but as soon as I find myself relishing in the sweet goodness this fresh breeze rolls in offering a light refreshing note of rock mineral and hay as if I am strolling through the woods on a sunny day.This is a rare and wonderful delight and I highly recommend trying some tea from Nuvola! I know so far I have sampled about 5 of their teas and I have yet to find one that is less than stellar!', 'I will need to capture my thoughts better at a later date but this sampler from nuvolo was incredible. As some may be aware, I’m not a huge fan of oolongs but I do love my black tea. This is a wonderful blend of the two with a multitude of flavours.', '<strong>Special thank you to Nuvola Tea for sending me this surprise sample!</strong> Really it was quite a wonderful surprise. My first order from Nuvola came with two free samples, then a second two were sent promptly after they had heard of a simple mislabeling and then this one arrives unbidden in my mail box Tuesday morning! What a wonderful generous surprise!I feel a tinge of guilt as I still haven’t reviewed the Pouchong they sent last time, but yesterday I was in the mood, nay in need of a good black tea. See I’m on a week long staycation, husband and son are in Indiana, I should be spending most of my time cleaning an organizing, but my sister gave me three books on Sunday, the Hunger Games trilogy and I have devoured them. I started reading Monday evening and stayed up until 4am finishing the first book, I never stay up that late and when I do I’m usually sick. I survived though had a tea date at Clementines with my friend Michelle the. Had her over for Milk Oolong (oh my goodness another thing to review). When she left I started the second book, then went to the local brewery with my sister for a very late dinner and a flight of beer, got home and continued reading, I willed muself to go to bed an hour earlier leaving a few chapters for the morning. That was the morning I needed this tea.This tea, this tea is lovely! I’ve only ever had two other black teas from Taiwan and only one other “black oolong”. The leaves on this one are gorgeous both dry and especially when wet, the stems and edges have a redness to them though the centers are most definitely black, they are full, slightly twisted, not huge but a good size. The smell is dark, rich, intoxicating, it reminds me of cocoa but not quite the way other black teas do, this one is unique. It’s not quite chocolately and not quite bready, it is sweet and rich in ways I’m not used to describing in tea. It reminds me a bit of brandy. But first I should mention the first sip had a sea air taste to it, again not fishy, though maybe the slightest bit salty, I could taste some of the vegetal qualities of the oolong, then it got darker and sweeter like currants or plums. I reinfused it several time, coming back to it after a car appointment and toward the end it took on a lighter more floral quality like Darjeeling, no more like Oriental Beauty. Very lovely!It kept me company reading yesterday and I got to bed at a much reasonable hour half way through the final book that I finished a couple hours ago. Been a long time since I’ve indulged in a good fiction novel and I’m grateful to Nuvola for sending me such a wonderful reading partner in this lonely house.', 'Backlog:I love the aroma to this tea – it is sweet and slightly woodsy, and it reminded me of my home … here in the Pacific Northwest, after a rain.A delightful tea with a profound fruity note, honey-esque tones, also notes of wood and flower.

I am suspicious that someone actually read my profile and tea preferences, because I can’t think of any two of their teas that I would like to try more.Anyway, back to the tea. I brewed this early Sunday morning before I went out to sit on the porch with my husband. It was an unseasonably cool and cloudy morning, and with the addition to this tea it was a perfect experience. The blend has the full body of a solid Earl Grey but with a lovely creamy malt. To my surprise, though, it is just as refreshing as a non-cream counterpart.

I brewed this tea at 205 degrees for four and half minutes and found it to be perfect. It tasted smooth, creamy and had a well balanced blend of bergamot and vanilla. The only thing that kept me from giving this tea a higher score was the fact I developed a slight slick feeling in my mouth about 20 minutes after I was finished drinking it.

This was the last of the first flush Darjeeling samples Vahdam Teas sent me last month. I still have an oolong and two white tea samples to finish, one of which is the Avongrove Emperor, a tea I’ve been wanting to try for over a year. Since I’ve been impressed with the other teas I have received from Vahdam, I will likely get to those in the near future. This Darjeeling was yet another hit.I prepared this tea in the Western style. I steeped 3 grams of loose tea leaves in approximately 8 ounces of 194 F water for 5 minutes. I did not attempt any additional infusions.Prior to infusion, the dry tea leaves produced subtly nutty, grassy aromas. After infusion, I noted scents of roasted almond, malt, Muscatel, grass, and straw. In the mouth, the liquor displayed a slight astringency along with notes of wood, grass, straw, lemon rind, Muscatel, malt, toast, beechnut, roasted almond, pungent herbs, and chestnut. There were hints of orange and mango lurking in the background too. The finish was somewhat dry, featuring lingering impressions of nuts, malt, grass, straw, and Muscatel.Vahdam Teas impressed me once again with this Darjeeling. Of their offerings I have sampled in the past month, this one possessed the aroma and flavor profiles I most often associate with first flush Darjeelings. It, however, was not my favorite. I came to appreciate some of the milder, fruitier, sweeter first flush teas more during this time, but I still would not hesitate to recommend this tea to anyone looking for a quality first flush Darjeeling.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Almond, Astringent, Chestnut, Grass, Herbs, Lemon, Malt, Mango, Muscatel, Nutty, Orange, Straw, Toast, Wood\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'I was surprised when I opened the sealed pack for this tea because the dried leaves were much greener than I expected! For a black tea (even a first flush), I was expecting darker leaves. But these leaves are definitely a bright green—no hint of darkness to them at all!I steeped the tea using 4 grams of dried leaves in 12 ounces of near boiling water for 4 minutes.The tea brewed into a very bright, pleasant liquor—very similar to a Helles beer or even a chamomile tisane. The first aromas I discovered coming from the liquor reminded me much more of a green or oolong tea instead of a black tea. It was a vegetal aroma, with a slight floral and muscatel scent. Very pleasant.The vegetal aroma of the tea didn’t translate into the flavor, though. The primary flavors I discovered were nutty, muscatel, citrus, and apricot. It also had a very slight buttery aftertaste—maybe an extension of the nutty flavor…? A slight tang to it which reminded me of an oolong, but not as defined.Overall, this was a tea of excellent quality and flavor—one that I will enjoy having again.

Then I saw TastyBrew’s review of this tea &amp; there was a conversation somewhere in the discussion boards about it too, &amp; it was like: I must have this! I’m salivating already! One of the awesome things about STACY is that she actually participates regularly on Steepster, &amp; it was SO EASY to have her add an oz of this. I am SO GLAD I did! Because OH MY GOD, it is DELICIOUS!  Ms Theresa, whispering “shhhhh, little terri, use your inside voice” LT “Sorry, it’s just SO YUMMY!!!”So, I’ll confess, as soon as I opened the box yesterday I opened this tea &amp; breathed in. The smell of the dry tea freaked me out a little, it’s very buttery, WAY buttery, almost too buttery smelling, &amp; cream-like too. It’s SO rich smelling! I was a little nervous…BUT I brewed it, &amp; this afternoon I brewed another cup, &amp; it is the best tasting caramel tea I’ve ever tasted. Unbelievably delicious. Also, I love vanilla, but haven’t been all that excited about any of the vanilla teas I’ve tried. Even vanilla comoro didn’t quite deliver what I was hoping for, although brewed double strength it’s not bad. I think the last time I had that, I said that I wished I could add caramel flavor to it.My wish came true in this tea! The Assam is assertive enough to give the cup depth, the Vanilla &amp; Caramel are so perfectly balanced but also strong enough to really be tasted. As far as I’m concerned, Stacy is the Mistress of the Arts &amp; this is the quintessential Caramel Vanilla tea! It even re-steeps rather well! We love you Stacy! You Rock!BTW, TastyBrew’s review of this tea is so perfect, that I’m just rambling!', 'It’s so annoying when your mind is in the mood for tea, but your body simply isn’t. I woke up this morning and groggily stumbled into the kitchen, but no tea in particular was calling to me. Last night I’d had high hopes of trying some of my new teas this morning, but it was a different story when I woke up. So I brewed up something that’s tried and true, that I can generally rely on to brew a consistent cup. And it still tasted lovely and I felt all validated for having topped up with my last Butiki order, but I’m still just generally “not feeling it” as far as tea is concerned. Not a bad thing necessarily though, as I drink a lot of black tea and taking a break for a few hours never hurt anybody…much.It’s Friday! May the work day pass quickly.', 'My Butiki order should be in on Wednesday, so I’m drinking this down today. Now I’ve only got one Butiki tea in my cupboard! :OI’m drinking this, looking at job ads, and watching Supernatural! This season (3) has Ruby in it, and so far I really like her. I also can’t wait to get to the end to see how they resolve everything.Later I’m going to pack up some teas for <strong>Sil</strong>. Not sure when or how but I’m planning to see her before Christmas to do a tea swap!Oh, also I really wish Steepster had a way to compare two people’s ratings – it’d be a lot easier finding teas <strong>Sil</strong> hasn’t tried if I could just hit a compare button. :P', 'You know when you’re sure there’s a sip down and then evethough you drink giant mugs of tea, there just isn’t enough to actually sip down? So now I have enough left for a single “normal” cup of this tea. I’m ok with that as there is a large butiki order planned in my near future. It’s actually part of the reason I’m trying to figure out which teas I’m very nearly done with to sipthem down and make room for them to come back OR be replaced with other butiki teas.This one is very nearly always going to be a restock. I love the blending of the caramel, vanilla and Assam. Stacy pretty much rocks my world, even the blends I don’t love as much are always expertly crafted and have their merits :)', 'Not gonna lie. I’m feeling pretty special right now. It was an amazing day. Weather peaked out around 78. Unheard of and record breaking for Portland in March. After so much rain and gray weather it’s so much fun to see all the people suddenly emerge from hibernation and fill the streets and parks with nothing but laughter and smiles.After an impromptu bbq at a friends and a few of my other favorite beverage, I got home to find my Butiki order had arrived already. The primary purpose (other than trying some more amazing teas) was for me to sample a few teas that may serve as the base for a custom hops tea that stacy is making for me. But the only tea I had my eye on tonight was the Caramel Vanilla Assam tea. Despite the late hour and my rule about no black tea after 5ish, I couldn’t resist.This is brand new blend that she wrote about on FB and I asked her to include it in my order. And man am I glad I did. Cause seriously, I love when you have insanely high expectations for something, and not only does it meet your expectations, but blows it out.This is no ordinary caramel flavored tea. In fact, it doesn’t even taste like caramel flavor. It tastes like if you were to plant a tea plant in a butter caramel and then water it with only vanilla and see what grew. Its as though caramel is actually a part of the tea. I couldn’t separate out the tea flavor from the caramel flavor. Like how the chocolate flavor is just part of LB, not added, but just a part of it. That’s how the caramel flavor is in this tea. It’s not an in your face flavor, but not subtle either.In case you can’t tell yet, I friggin love this tea. Totally straight. No sugar/honey or cream. It reminds me so much of those individually wrapped in wax paper vanilla butter caramels you can get when you’re checking out in fancy grocery stores.This is hands down my favorite caramel tea. Thanks for letting me try this Stacy! Please don’t ever stop making it!!!!<strong>Update</strong> I had this again this morning and added some sugar per Stacy’s suggestion. The caramel flavor is even more pronounced. I think I prefer it straight though. Either way it’s super good.', 'I woke up to rain outside my window, and a beautiful day ahead of me. I’ve got my writing to do, but then I’m going to visit my best friend, and have a full day with her listening to books on tape and knitting. She’s teaching me, and I need a consultation on my project (the most basic of basic scarves).  So, as I looked at the teas in my cupboard, I decided that only one would really, really do the trick. My beloved Caramel Vanilla Assam. I often drink my morning cup of tea while running about, preparing for the day, or watching videos on youtube. Not today. TOday I just sat with my little pot, and sipped at this beautiful blend, savoring the flavors. A wonderful start to today. I approve.', 'Last cup of the day! I drank this tea to ward off the ice cream cravings I kept getting tonight. Sweet and delicious as usual- It really did the trick.', 'Trying this a second time (I had misplaced it briefly! The horror!) – my first attempt was not as good as I’d hoped, so fingers crossed #2 is better.I think that overall, this tea isn’t quite what I was hoping for it to be. Yes, the base is amazing, and there’s no astringency. Yes, I can taste the caramel, though not a great deal of vanilla. Yes, the tea <em>tastes good</em>. But, I think I’d rather just have plain PTA over this blend. Or alternately, Two Friends, which is pretty much the most perfect flavoured tea ever. I’m not sure whether it’s just that I want more obvious caramelly/vanilla, or that the raisiny notes are poking out where they don’t quite fit for me. I mean, I’m not going to have any issues drinking the rest of this. And I’m certainly going to enjoy it. But I think my cupboard staples will just be Two Friends and unflavoured PTA, and I’ll leave this for those who will enjoy it more :)', 'Should I be admitting that I have loads of this tea left? At least 2 oz, maybe closer to 3…And it’s still delicious. Yumyumyum.Will definitely do a second steep when I get home.', 'Almost like drinking Caramilk, although never as sweet and cloying. My favourite thing about this one is the hot caramel smell that attaches itself to the cup. I’ve found it’s a good tea to smother most dessert cravings.I tried adding soy milk to it a couple days back and that completely diluted everything. Maybe a longer steep time would’ve helped, but I don’t feel like playing around anymore when I know I’ve got a good thing going already.I love the assam base for this blend; I may actually like the assam more on it’s own than here. It’s going on my “must haves” list for fall, though. This tea, a warm fireplace, a textbook, and a chilly night sounds pretty fine to me.<strong>Edit</strong>: I’m finally starting to like this tea in it’s own right and not just for its assam base. Being generous with the two teaspoon serving, and stirring after steeping, takes this tea up a notch for me.

What the heck!? It almost feels numb and I can barely taste anything else. As I keep drinking it, it spreads and my whole mouth is coated by cream. It’s the oddest sensation coming from a liquid.There is more going on once I actually get over the creamy sensation. The tea is darkly sweet, just barely roasty, and with a light floral note I can’t identify.As I near the end of the cup, the creamy sensation deteriorates and gets slightly chalky or gritty- almost like my mouth is fighting the illusion of creaminess. This is when it becomes more like creme brulee.This tea definitely took me on a sensation roller-coaster that was more texture than taste. Interesting tea! I’d have to try it again to see if I really like it or not.', 'I think this is still definitely my favorite from the Héritage Gourmand collection. I like that the flavor here is very mild. The texture is smooth and silky, and the toasted rice really makes it smell like an authentic baked good. I used to live right near St. Honoré in Portland (this was during a veganism hiatus) and my favorite things to get were the Cannelés.', 'I ended up with this tea because Macaron – also part of the Héritage Gourmand collection and an all-around excellent tea I was able to try thanks to <strong>Shelley_Lorraine</strong> – was sold out. I’d never heard of canelé before, but evidently it’s a custard-filled pastry with caramelized crust.The tea base here is pleasant and smooth – maybe a Ceylon or similar? There’s a creamy quality to the tea, which is pleasant, and a slightly burnt one, which is less so. It gestures toward vanilla, I think, but never quite reaches it. This tea is okay, but only okay – it’s not something I’d buy again, and that goes doubly given how pricey MF is. I did get an awesome tin in the bargain, so there’s that.', 'Another hit from Mariage Freres!I had this one on my mid-morning break. Pleasant flavor, not too strong, not bitter or astringent. I couldn’t taste individual flavors, but it smelled sort of buttery, creamy. Really nice!', 'This tea has been on my wishlist for ages and I finally got to try it today, thanks to beelicious. AMAZING! I’ve had a lot of delicious dessert teas that I thoroughly enjoyed, but this one takes things to a whole new level. I literally felt like I was drinking a melted eclair as I worked my way through this cup of deliciousness. Is so incredibly sweet and rich and creamy…and that’s without any sweetener!

I have to say, I was so happy that she was willing to send me some of this, as this is the only Héritage Gourmand tea that I didn’t get from boychik. Also, the dessert that this tea is based on looks and sounds amazing… It’s basically a little cake-like thing baked in a tiny bundt-like mold, and it’s custardy on the inside while being dark and caramelized on the outside. And it’s flavored with rum and vanilla, yums! I think we all need to go to France, just to go on a pastry-eating binge. Anyway! The tea itself has these little white puffs in it, and I’m not sure whether they’re marshmallows or super-puffed rice. I also see something that looks like cacao shells, which confuses me since there’s no chocolate in this dessert. Smells sweet and yummy though!As soon as the water hit the leaves, I was rewarded with an amazing creamy vanilla and caramel aroma. The scent of this tea reminds me of crème brûlée, sweet and custardy with creamy caramel notes. I added a little bit of raw sugar to my cup. Yum, I think this is the best caramel tea I’ve had so far. It’s not necessarily a super dark and rich caramel, more of a creamy caramel custard or sauce. Yum, vanilla caramel swirl!\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Butter, Caramel, Creamy, Custard, Sweet, Vanilla\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Thanks goes out to <strong>Greenteafairy</strong> for a sample if this tea!This tea is smooth and rich, yet has a light caramel flavor. I’m not tasting much of the tea base here, just the caramel. It reminds me a bit of MF’s Wedding Imperial which is impossibly difficult to brew a perfect cup of. This tea is much more forgiving in the brewing department and lacks the bitterness that Wedding Imperial is prone to. I like this tea, but probably not enough to buy a tin of it.', 'Thanks <strong>CharlotteZero</strong> for sending me samples of all your heritage gourmand teas! You are AWESOME!I’ve been wanting to try these for a long time and was just going to take the plunge and order, but <strong>CharlotteZero</strong> was kind enough to send me samples so I didn’t have to order blindly.To be honest, as much as I wanted them to live up to my expectations that I had going in, I was also kind of hoping they would be a complete disappointment, as six 100g tins of this tea would cost me $270 CAD. My expectations were so high that I was actually anticipating that I would be somewhat disappointed.But, oh my god is this tea f’n delicious! I guess I’m jumping the gun a bit because I’ve only tried this one and Financier, but I would make an order just for this tea. I didn’t know what a Cannele was, but I looked it up and this tea tastes exactly how I imagined a Cannele would taste. You can taste the custardy inside of the pastry and the carmelized outside. This is heaven and the cup is gone. Hopefully this isn’t goodbye.', 'And that’s a sipdown. Thanks again, charlotte0!I tried my last serving of this tea with half the amount of sugar I usually put in, as well as a bit of cream to thicken it up a bit. I still can’t say I was all that taken by it: I found the tea to still taste far too thin, and the flavouring was just rather lackluster for lack of a better term. I also occasionally get hints of something sort of metallic, and it seems to be more often in French teas than other types, and I’m not sure if it’s just me, but even if it is, I don’t really care what a tea tastes like in anyone else’s mouth anyway LOL.

(found here: <a href=\"http://www.darjeelingteaxpress.com/products/2011-Darjeeling-First-Flush-Jungpana-Black-Tea.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.darjeelingteaxpress.com/products/2011-Darjeeling-First-Flush-Jungpana-Black-Tea.html</a>)And now for the tea! A rich sweet aroma followed by an equally sweet and delicious liquor – hardly a touch of astringency but with that characteristic darjeeling flavour – yum!!It was so funny, because I really just walked into the store to buy some Buttered Rum (currently the top rated tea on Steepster!!), and one of the workers recognized me and said “Hey, I have something for you! Darjeeling first flush!” Nearly knocked me off my feet! Haha..', 'I’m not going to rate this tea. I don’t know what happened, but I swear I got a bad batch. I prepared it every which way and <strong>every</strong> time it came out bitter to the point that I spit it out and just dumped the entire cup down the drain. I was very disappointed with this tea and I have no explanation for the consistently poor outcomes I got when trying to brew it.', 'I received my DT order this morning just in time to make this for my morning tea.The leaves dry looked quite green, mixed with dark, and smelled delectably fresh and grassy. It turned out to be lovely, as expected. Very smooth, lightly astringent, light but rounded. It had a really nice sweetness, and I was getting some floral from it. Yum! I was hoping it wouldn’t stand out too much, discouraging me from buying more.', 'Another $1 Straight tea, on the recommendation of the sales girl…<strong>First steep</strong>: I think I left the bag in a touch too long because as lovely as this is there’s a bitterness that lingers on my tongue. Oops.<strong>Second steep</strong>: Much improved from the first steep: earthy, smooth, slightly floral, and very much a “Darjeeling”. There’s just something about that flavour that one can’t quite describe.<strong>Third steep</strong>: Not as flavourful as the first or second, but still steepable!', 'The leaf is a beautiful mix of green and dark…steeped, it loves to unfurl freely in the pot. Do not trap this leaf in a ball or bag, allow it room to move. It is medium and small broken pieces once fully steeped.  The liquor is golden and the aroma distinctly the woodsy, earthy Darjeeling.  It has the flavour of dark truffles, and lingers on the back of the tongue.  Enjoy this brew without milk or other adornments, as it deserves your full attention.', 'So light and tasty!', 'This is why I love tea. This is the tea you give to wine lovers, tea n00bs and tea snobs. I have yet to find a person who doesn’t like this tea.

This is what I have been chasing ever since more than a year ago when I had my introduction to Yunnans by chance in a random coffee shop. Dense and chewy, mildly sweet, leathery, thick and wonderful.

The first steep is best but the second is okay if you are trying to stretch your supply.I’m starting to think what I taste as smoke is something else since so many others don’t notice smoke in teas that I <strong>do</strong> notice it in.

But the smell as I poured it out of the pot was amazing. Like, wake me up amazing. Rich and sweet like a thin, fragrant syrup with just a tickle of black pepper. That’s a lovely morning greeting.The taste is really flavorful and pretty. Earthy – a hint of leather, a bit musty; floral – in a way that reminds me of a much milder version of germanium oil (in a way that doesn’t make me gag); spicy – just a lovely tickle of black pepper during the sip, a bit of mentholated tang (camphor maybe?) in the very late aftertaste; sweet – with malt and a faint note of something between caramel sauce and one of those cheap butterscotch hard candy.So yeah, lots of stuff going on in this tea but it’s allover so soft and pretty that it doesn’t feel overwhelming. It’s really kind of wonderful. I think I definitely need to get more of this. This is seriously one of the best Yunnans I’ve had in a while.', 'Day 3 in Florida, 1st sip down of the day.

While not explicitly stated as being a Dian Hong, it had the earthy, and mid-astringent character of one. There was a bit of a nectarine nuance there, but not as much as a Yunnan Gold.

Make of that what you will.', 'Yet, another favorite of this illustrious brand!Aroma: It’s exactly as the website describes it…spicy, sweet and leathery, very pleasant.Taste: A duplicate of the aromas. Spicy, sweet and leathery [if one could taste leather…not off-putting at all!. This tea is a juxtaposition of tastes, meaning, it is spicy, sweet and leathery simultaneously; complex yet linear and delicate. A fine tea to enjoy throughout the day…better for afternoon and early evening due to not much of a caffeine kick for a morning jolt. Yunnan teas have some body to them and yet they are not mouth filling or possess that “drying” effect or the tannins of other black teas. Very delicious teas, indeed!Aftertaste: More of a lingering sweetness of raisins and burnt caramel [not charred tasting at all and not cloying either. A little spicy as well but only intermingled, not prominent.I like Yunnan teas because of it’s complex characteristics…spicy, sweet, delicate and yet it has some body and complexity to it.A highly recommended tea to have in one’s collection!

I used to adore them when I was younger, and not being in the mood to continue my Earl Grey and Darjeeling binge, I decided to crack open this container of Yunnan. I needed the change of pace, and as it turned out, this was exactly what I had been missing for years.Prior to infusion the dry tea leaves showed a mixture of dark green and black with pretty gold tips. The aroma was a mixture of must, leather, and cocoa powder with just a hint of an almost mildewy, grassy aroma. After proper steeping, the liquor showed a beautiful dark amber with an aroma of caramel, malt, leather, must, cocoa, and grass.In the mouth, I detected distinct notes of cocoa, caramel, molasses, tobacco, leather, malt, must, wood, grass, wildflower honey, and slight floral, herbal notes (perhaps similar to a mixture of anise, licorice, and ginseng, but I could not quite put my finger on it). This tea was distinctly smooth and rich in texture with a satisfying body and a finish of cocoa, caramel, malt, honey, leather, and wood.Overall, I was very impressed with this tea. It reminded me of why I used to love Yunnan black teas so much and how much more frequently I need to revisit them.

One I have been wanting to try for a while! I was worried that steeping two teaspoons of this one would ruin it, but it didn’t at all. The way I steeped it, I couldn’t imagine it getting any better. The leaves are mostly a bronze gold. The flavor is delicious and complex. The medium amber cup is a delicious Yunnan – honey, sweet potato, hints of something fruity and a lovely almost wine quality. The subtle flavor notes work really well together. I didn’t find many chocolate notes, but that isn’t to say this is a light flavored tea. It’s dark while not getting to chocolate levels. The second steep was a little different, with hints of smokiness and starchy chewy bread notes and also EARTHY somehow. The flavors in the previous steep staying in the background. A tasty tea!

I ended up steeping it for 3 minutes at 205 f and that was definitely overkill because I got really intense tobacco notes that made it difficult for me to drink this without milk. I also noticed spicy pepper-y notes and a bit of the sweet potato type of flavor that seems characteristic of yunnans.I tried a 2nd steep for 90 seconds and now it seems like it doesn’t have enough flavor… it could be I steeped all the flavor out of it at the 3 minute mark. :) Anyway the 2nd steep isn’t bad but I’m still getting tobacco notes with some caramel. Tobacco isn’t really my favorite flavor in tea.this doesn’t seem to be my favorite yunnan to date but it isn’t terrible.

This. This, is Earl Grey done right. Much love.', 'So, I have started a new and exciting project! I have decided to make my own tea tray for my various Gongfu brewing sessions. Let’s just say I am tired of spilling water everywhere on my desk, and since I am not so much having the monies I decided to be all crafty. Using a frame, some paint stirrers, some caulk, varnish, a small cake pan, and paint, I will create my new toy. Pictures will show up when I finish it…or tears will flow if I ruin it!Today’s tea is an English tea time classic! Considered to be one of the most famous Western teas, I certainly know I have been drinking it since I was a tiny child. Earl Grey Premium by Ocean of Tea is a blend of premium black tea and bergamot oil, as expected from a tea named Earl Grey Premium. The aroma is a very potent bergamot, bright and lemony! It is certainly a tea to sniff when you want to wake up and be alert. There is also a tiny bit of sweetness and a nice finish of malt.Brewing the leaves brings out a much stronger malty tone to the very citrus heavy tea. I am amazed at how fresh the bergamot aroma’s is, it smells more like sniffing a fresh fruit than the oil. The liquid once the leaves have been removed is creamy and malty with a hint of cocoa and strong bergamot. It smells quite zingy!Tasting time! The mouthfeel is dry, not rasping and puckering, but a nice brisk dryness. The tea is a little astringent, but not unpleasantly so, it has that brisk bite to it that really wakes you up. I know some people really object to teas having any bitterness to it at all, I personally like it when certain black teas have a bit of a bite…not enough to be nasty of course, just that hint, kinda like eating fresh kale or bitter greens, I just find it tasty. Of course there is more to this tea, there is a nice bergamot kick that leaves a bit of sourness causing a salivary response, goodbye dryness! After that there is smooth malt and a subtle sweetness that lingers to the finish. Usually when I describe an optimal Earl, I am lauding the tea’s tendency to not kick me with bergamot, this Earl certainly kicks with bergamot, but it is such a fresh and clean citrus taste that I really like it.For blog and photos: <a href=\"http://ramblingbutterflythoughts.blogspot.com/2014/05/ocean-of-tea-earl-grey-premium-tea.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://ramblingbutterflythoughts.blogspot.com/2014/05/ocean-of-tea-earl-grey-premium-tea.html</a>'], 'Polarity': [0.25840909090909087, 0.07222222222222223, 0.07457482993197277, 0.15894113327149045], 'Mouthfeel': '', 'Flavor Profile': {'Spicy': 0.6666666666666666, 'Char': 0.0, 'Sweet': 0.26666666666666666, 'Nutty': 0.06666666666666667, 'Floral': 0.0, 'Herbs': 0.0, 'Vegetables': 0.0, 'Grass': 0.0, 'Wood': 0.0, 'Earth': 0.0, 'Mineral': 0.0, 'Marine': 0.0, 'Berry': 0.0, 'Citrus': 0.0, 'Tree Fruit': 0.0, 'Tropical': 0.0}}\n",

My tasting note is certainly going to pale in comparison to the two that preceded it!I was feeling like something interesting and on the “heavier” side tonight, so chose to brew up this tea. I like lapsang souchong in moderation (and particularly with milk), but who knows what this one will be like (well, a couple people do. But not me!)The aroma of this tea is like smoked meat. Beef jerky. Campfire. It’s quite strong, and to my untrained nose, smells much like any lapsang souchong.The flavour, however, is where it differs from other lapsangs I’ve tried. The smoke is unbelievably smooth here, no astringency, no sharp bite at all. In fact, the tea finishes with a surprising sweetness! I used about 2 tsp of leaf for 8 oz. of water, and am surprised at how delicious this is! It definitely doesn’t require any additions, although I’m certain it would hold up to them.Hopefully I can get in a few more infusions tomorrow!ETA: Second infusion, a couple minutes. This is truly unlike any lapsang I’ve previously tried. The smoke is still heavy in the second infusion, but there’s this amazing sweetness to it, and I can really taste the black tea underneath it. I have to admit that although this is a neat experience, I really can’t see myself ever really selecting such a tea to drink just on a whim (or if I did, I’d be dosing it with sweetener and milk and these nuances would be lost).', 'It’s difficult to come behind <strong>Paul</strong> and his Pulitzer Prize winning review… such a lovely write-up of this fine tea, but I’ll do a little follow-up.Paul was so right…the leaves are beautiful.Sometimes, I look at the leaves and marvel. Long and twisted, blackish/brown with a light smoky scent. I mean it, light smoke.I love Lapsang. I’ve sent out so much China Lapsang Souchong from my local tea shop (Happy Lucky’s) that many of you have tasted it and know what I’m talking about. It’s been all over the United States, Canada and the U.K. (I even sent some to..gulp…David Duckler!)  I have some nerve don’t I!My favorite Lapsang has been my favorite because it’s smoky and sweet. I use Lapsang Souchong mainly to COOK with! (David Duckler used what I sent him for a fish rub which is something that I do ground together with Urfa Chili, Peppercorns and Sea Salt)Master Bi’s Lapsang is <strong>NOT</strong> for cooking (unless I win the lottery and go to China and buy up all of Master Bi’s stock)! This tea is for <strong>DRINKING</strong>!When I was drinking the tea, the flavor wasn’t harsh or flat, but smooth…velvety smooth with a gentle sweetness that’s in a different league than any Lapsang I’ve had… ever.The Smokiness is like the aftertaste of great bacon or bbq…not the firepit smoke in your face. No smoke knocks you down!Here’s the part that got my ‘eyes wide open’…I could still taste the ‘tea’ under the smoke. Yes, a raisin, floral, bakery goodness that was present, wafting around in the aroma and taste.  Such complexity is not there in Lapsangs most of the time (IF EVER)!Oh David Duckler, if you can get this as an item for regular ordering…<strong>it’s the BEST LAPSANG I’ve ever tasted!</strong>(As an experiment for those who love Lapsang’s, I added some milk and the flavor wasn’t diminished at all. Still spectacular!)<strong>Update</strong> Further steepings are amazing!!! The roasty oolong flavor with a slight smokiness is the best of the best taste! This is not like anything you can imagine when you think of a Lapsang. Please, don’t just stop at the first steep!I just wrote a story on my blog if anyone is interested: <a href=\"http://www.teaandincense.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">www.teaandincense.com</a>Here’s an excerpt: Our first Christmas…living in the forest community of Paradise…we went on an adventure to cut down a tree together. We bundled up nice and warm and piled into my car. Christmas carols were blasting from my tape deck and I had a big thermos of hot cider to share. The tree farm was decked out with lights and decorations… welcoming the 6 of us to cut down any tree for $10. (they had Christmas music playing too and a fire pit for warming hands and eating free cookies)We took our time… going from tree to tree. Which one would it be? Too tall? Too short, too bare or too fat?! Our tree had to be perfect! We all had to agree! For these girls, Christmas wasn’t always a happy time. Someone was often drunk or high or missing at home (if there was a home at all). Some were beaten at holidays.Finally, the nod was given and we drank some cider to seal the deal. The tree was tied to the top of the car and off we went to decorate our tree!When we got home, someone had come by with a note that they wanted to give us a tree. I had to make a quick call of thanks and head them off. How nice of them though!The next day, when I returned from work…the girls were all excited!“Mom, look what’s in the kitchen…come and see…!”', '<strong>Thank you so much to both David Duckler and Master Bi for this opportunity!</strong>This is one incredible tea. I must admit that I have never had a Lapsang Souchong before this tea, as I always had the assumption I would dislike the smokiness. I occasionally like the hint of “smoke” flavors in some higher roast oolongs or pu’ers, but the smell of actual thick smoke has me gagging. This tea, though, has shown me what Lapsang Souchong can really be all about. It is the Truth of flavored teas. The smoke enhancements are so well integrated into the leaves’ flavor profile here that it is impossible to tell where the tea ends and the flavoring begins. They seem one and the same. The flavors are so well enmeshed and it produces this savory, textural beauty of taste. And it certainly is a taste like no other. I’ll take you through my gong fu session, but the images and descriptions I use to convey this tea I will admit that I would have been confused and possibly even turned off by them if someone had described them to me when discussing a tea. Yet, somehow, this tea manages to turn this unlikely flavor profile into something incredible.I use about 2 grams of dry leaf in my 100 mL gaiwan, a bit less than a quarter full. I first came up with this ratio because I was being stingy and wanted to make this small sample last forever, but [thankfully! it turned out to work quite well. While I’m on the topic, I’ll mention that they look a great deal like a heavily roasted mi lan xiang’s dry leaves.Wash: 3 +/-1 seconds<strong>Steep 1</strong> (4\"): Based on the smell of the wet leaves, and especially the dry leaves (and also my [incorrect perception of what smoked tea was), I expected the first sip to assault me with deep, smoky flavors and a drying texture. Psht! This was nothing like that. This is <strong>juicy</strong>. It’s savory. It certainly is thick, but has the most brilliant, clear amber liquor to juxtapose it. I think the best way to describe this taste is to attempt to call to mind a perfectly barbecued pork brisket. Yes, that’s correct. Imagine a succulent, moist brisket seasoned with a humble spread of salt and a dry rub of natural spices allowed to slow cook for hours in a smoker with natural hickory or mesquite wood. Perhaps add a touch of citrus zest when it’s finished. Yup. That’s this tea to me, who has lived in the southern US his whole life, and grown well-accustomed to the flavors of awesome barbecue.<strong>Steep 2</strong> (10\"): Oh yeah, so if you could tell by the last steep’s description, the whole “smoky” taste wasn’t that overbearing. In fact, it wasn’t until this steep that I was actually made well aware of it at the top of each sip. Like I mentioned before, this tea isn’t boasting it’s smoky flavor. Instead, the smoke intensifies and draws out the depth and interesting notes of the tea leaves, putting a slight spin on them. The savory goodness and salty/spiciness also increases here, all coming together with the meaty flavors, rounding out the body and creating a very deep complexity. The mouthfeel becomes thicker and spicier, and with the increased “meaty” flavors, becomes almost “chewy.” There is also a tingling felt all over the surface of the tongue. This is also the first point where I can really tell that this is tea. That “pure” black tea flavor becomes very prominent, and one can pick out the inherent tea leaf sweetness brought into this steep.<strong>Steep 3</strong> (20\"): At this point, all the flavor nuances kind of meet in the middle, creating an even deeper, thicker body than before. The liquor’s appearance becomes a darker golden brown to match, although none of the clarity is lost. The sweetness is also much stronger in this steep. It almost seems like a nice honey glaze on the brisket I mentioned above. Ohhhhh it’s good.As a side note, while I was impatiently waiting for the next steep to do it’s thing, I took a sip of the still-warm wash and was astounded. Relatively speaking, it’s the best wash I’ve tasted for a tea. It’s like a reallyyyy weak version of steep 1, but twice as sweet. I’m pretty sure the next time I taste this I’m going to forget the wash…<strong>Steep 4</strong> (30\"): So at this point the smoke becomes less powerful, actually allowing other flavors to rise above it. In this and the next steep, that sweet glaze-like flavor I mentioned from the last steep is most prominent. In the next, a honey sweetness is most apparent. This steep is very similar to the last, besides a slight apple-y flavor. Hmmmm… applewood-smoked bacon, anyone? Actually, the aroma of the wet leaves becomes very reminiscent of this, especially after the first few steeps and the smoky aromas begin to fade.At this point, I’ll mention the aftertaste, which is thick, tangy, and smoky. The most amazing flavors really come out on the exhale after every sip.<strong>Steep 5</strong> (40\"): From most to least expressive: honey, smoke, spice (and lots of it), meat, savory, apple, salt. The mouthfeel at this point is very spicy and lingers longgg after a sip. The insides of my cheeks and roof of mouth are left nice and tingly.<strong>Steep 6</strong> (1’): At this point the tea starts fading, although the same basic flavor profile as the last steep is displayed. I think I took this tea to a few more steeps the first time I tried it, but I didn’t have anything noteworthy on them.So, all in all, this tea is a game changer. It has completely redefined what I perceive flavored or scented teas to be. There is a hand-rolled jasmine sample that came in my David’s Choice box as well, and I’m itching to try that one now that I’ve had this, just to see how the scenting has been transcended. At any rate, this Lapsang Souchong is a masterful work of art. I wish I had had something to compare it to previously, as it seems now that any Lapsang Souchong that I consume after this point will seem monotonous and dull. Ah well. Such is tea. :)', 'Ok, I don’t really have any experience with Lapsang Souchong’s…but I feel as if I just completely spoiled any future tries of other Lapsang teas.This is an absolutely pleasant and comforting/warming tea… The way the smoke dances alternately between the background and in front. Sweet and smoky, I feel as if I should be relaxing behing a fireplace toasting marshmallows! Though I don’t want to eat anything at the moment because I want the pure taste of this great tea to engulf my mouth! As it says with the tea info, I can certainly see why this type of smoked tea is popular. The smoke mingles with the caramel and malt of the tea in a synergistic way, and it is taking me for a ride!!Lol looks like I may need to find a way to have 2 reserve subscriptions, as 2oz of these teas would be totally amazing!'], 'Polarity': [0.1845283882783883, 0.25791403619528624, 0.14250907990314768, 0.323171768707483], 'Mouthfeel': ' The mouthfeel at this point is very spicy and lingers longgg after a sip.', 'Flavor Profile': {'Spicy': 0.625, 'Char': 0.0, 'Sweet': 0.25, 'Nutty': 0.0625, 'Floral': 0.0, 'Herbs': 0.0, 'Vegetables': 0.0, 'Grass': 0.0, 'Wood': 0.0, 'Earth': 0.0, 'Mineral': 0.0, 'Marine': 0.0, 'Berry': 0.0, 'Citrus': 0.0625, 'Tree Fruit': 0.0, 'Tropical': 0.0}}\n",

I know how divisive it is—so many of my friends here in town loathe star anise in particular, alas—but luckily my husband enjoys all forms of it and dug this. I like that it’s precise—we’re not talking about the warm/hot spices of chai here just because they often go hand in hand with star anise; this is licorice, anise, fennel all over and lots of it (NB I’m talking about my experience of the flavor, not necessarily the actual ingredients which do include some other spices)—and layered—all of those multiple elements from the licorice family. I couldn’t drink it all the time because it is so very much this one thing and one thing only, with superhero-brawny (yet rounded and welcoming, never harsh) aroma and flavor, but I bow down to how thorough a tribute it is. With vanilla pound cake crackers today for afternoon tea, it evoked old fashioned homemade aniseed cake and scones beautifully. I also really like how the cardamom contributes to and amplifies the fennel’s cooling aspect in the long-lingering aftertaste.

Or like <em>wintergreen</em> licorice, which according to my mom, is the name for the type of licorice candies that are like peppermint swirl candies, but the swirl is blue instead of red.

It’s just too bad that it takes tea to lure me out into public. :PSo I’ve been waiting awhile for these teas and there are so many that I’m excited about, but THIS was the one I thought I’d start with.

I’ve had it for a while but forgot about it until now.It seems like licorice is one of those things people either love or hate but I definitely belong in the love camp, at least with natural licorice flavor and not those nasty “Red Vines”.I wouldn’t drink a chai plain but I sipped on this and it seems mild enough that you <strong>could</strong> drink it that way if you wanted to. I added about 1 tsp. of sugar to mine as well as one of those little creamer doo-dads from the office.I’m wondering what this would have been like with an asssam tea base, because MAN the spices are strong! I actually love fennel but this is knocking my socks off. The star anise &amp; cinnamon is also pretty strong here but I’m not picking up on the cardamom.

The licorice is still there, and even a slightly thick mouthfeel, but I can pick up a couple of the fainter supporting notes now.As it is after midnight, I do wish it wasn’t caffeinated, but since I’m still on winter break I’ll just channel the caffeine into more costuming.

Sweet licorice deliciousness!This tea is a yummy treat. It reminds me of Good N Plenty’s, only a bit more natural tasting. It’s sweet, but not cloyingly so. There is also a nice spice to the licorice that comes through beautifully in the back of the sip. I’m also getting a grain-like taste – <strong>NOT texture!</strong> The texture is smooth. The grain-like taste accompanies an almost milky aspect. I’m getting some nice cinnamon notes in the middle of the sip, and there is a nice mild floral aspect that lingers on the back of the tongue.Overall, I really enjoy this one. It makes a great dessert tea for those licorice lovers out there. I know I’m enjoying it this morning with my cinnamon streusel muffins. Perfect!', 'What am I doing?! I’m having the worst Butiki sip downs ever! My penance for hoarding and letting tea go bad. Or it could just be that I dumped all the dustings in the bottom of the bag in my steeper. I’m not getting much licorice, just that too-much-clove bitterness. Never noticed clove in this before. As I sip on I get a little more licorice and that tingling sensation on my tongue from the cloves. I’m not enjoying this cup. What a rotten way to say “So Long”.', 'This one never really appealed to me, despite its high ratings, since I tend not to be a big fan of licorice in tea. But in Butiki’s closing frenzy, I thought I might as well snap up a packet before it disappeared forever, just to see what all the fuss was about. And I’m glad I did. Both dry and steeped, it smelled weirdly—though not unpleasantly—like root beer, though the flavor was more clove-y (though there’s definitely some root beer in the background). It’s a tiny bit astringent, though a splash of almond milk mellowed it out (and subdued the spices some). This is a really nice, unusual chai, and one I’m really glad to have been able to try.', 'First off – I LOVE this tea. I hate actual licorice but love all licorice flavoured things… candy…sambuca…. hahaha but I can’t eat actual licorice – figure that one out for me! Anyways this smells AMAZING. I’d smell it all day if I could – unfortunately, I’m not getting as strong of an actual licorice taste from this – not that it isn’t there but I was sort of hoping it would… punch me in the face. (never thought I’d say <em>that</em>) Added a bit of sugar to it and it brought out the flavour a bit more but I’m thinking if I let it cool off the licorice might taste a little stronger.  And for the price – this tea was such a good deal, I’m glad it came in 1oz sizes vs the 1/2 ounce.  I’ll definitley be hoarding this one for a while. Very good.  We’ve only had a fleeting relationship Butiki, but I hope it was as good for you as it was for me… ;) now, onto my other teas from this order!', 'Finally digging into my Butiki samples that I got in a swap from… Janelle? a while back?This is tasty – a nice, light chai with a good balance of cinnamon and anise/fennel flavours. None of that back of the throat, cloying sweetness of licorice root, which I’m quite happy for.

Sweeter licorice is good too.Ah, this tea. A flavoured black, my favourite. It is so so licorice-y. What is most amazing is the mouth feel of it, and how it really feels and tastes and smells like you have been eating black licorice.

I was gonna be done with tea for the night, but after that Thunderstorm our laundry room flooded (a few inches of water over half the floor…) I just kinda went “Fuck it, I deserve one more cup”. It also means I realized one of my “mini goals” for yesterday, which was to finish all three sample teas that came in my Butiki order.Dry, the leaf of this one looked kinda waxy and smelled strongly of fennel. Hooray for fennel; I love fennel! Steeped up, the fennel and star anise were definitely the strongest flavours in the cup and for sure where the black licorice flavour was coming from. It was kinda weird having that flavour be provided by something other than licorice root in a tea, but I liked it a lot. However, there was also lots of spice because this is a chai (ergo why I was skeptical and only asked for a sample size) – and the cinnamon was really present and left an unpleasant dry feeling on my mouth.If you’ve ever done the cinnamon challenge before it sort of, in a way, felt a lot like that. That definitely detracted from the cup overall and will probably keep me from ordering this one again in the future. I’m glad I tried it though because the fennel was divine. I didn’t realize how much I was in a fennel mood until I had this one and had that secret craving satisfied.Only one thing left to say about this one; so long!', 'Oh, wow! I think I’ve already made it clear that I love spice teas, but this is really special. I wouldn’t have thought to put cinnamon with licorice but it works. It’s smooth and the sweetness of the licorice blends perfectly with the sharper cinnamon. I used to think I wasn’t a licorice fan but I’m finding I love it in teas. Definitely one for the to-buy list! A Butiki order may be in my future.', 'Slowly working through my untried Butikis. This one is a double win for me – the name makes me smile, because I love Douglas Adams, and a smile from me at work is a rare thing these days. Black licorice is also one of my favourite things, and to have it replicated in tea form is something out of my dreams. Usually licorice in tea is in root form, and I just don’t get along with that. Anyway, we started off an a good foot, as this tea has given me TWO reasons to be cheerful this morning!So. The tea. As per the recommended parameters, I gave 1.5 tsp of leaf 3.5 minutes in boiling water and added a splash of milk. While brewing, the scent is primarily chai like, with very prominent spice notes. The initial flavour is also predominantly chai, and I can pick out cinnamon, clove, cardamon and fennel. In a way, this is a tea of two halves, because as the initial chai flavour fades it leads naturally into a delicious, almost chewy, black licorice flavour. There’s a hint of aniseed sweetness, but it’s not really a particularly sweet blend – a hint of sugar might make this one more candy-like. I’m happy with it as is, though. Licorice isn’t a particularly sweet flavour to my mind, and I like the almost tarry, molasses-like depth of flavour that it adds to this blend.This is another Butiki stunner, and pretty much the perfect chai blend in my estimation.

I’m also intrigued by the fact that it uses both Laoshan gongfu black and Laoshan roasted oolong – this clearly isn’t your typical genmaicha!That’s borne out in the flavour, most of all. Whereas the roastiness in a “normal” genmaicha comes from the rice, here it’s clearly a result of the oolong. It’s roasty in the best possible way, with just an edge of almost-bitter toastiness amongst a lot of retained sweetness. I imagine a significant amount of the sweetness is coming from the strong malty backbone provided by the Laoshan black, but some of it is the oolong.Underneath the roastiness is a pretty significant chocolate flavour – to my tastes, it’s milk tending towards dark; creamy, with a hint of deeper, richer cocoa. The rice itself doesn’t appear to be contributing a lot, other than a very light starchiness. It adds to the mouthfeel, though, so I guess that’s something.This is one of the best genmaicha blends I’ve tried, even though it’s not particularly traditional. The quality is undeniable; it just shines through, and I’m enjoying the chocolate twist. It’s a shame LP doesn’t blend anymore because he had a hand for this kind of thing.', 'I’m sad to announce a sipdown of this fabulously rich dessert tea.

This one feels more chocolatey than the version from verdant and more “oolongy” It is also missing the roastyness from the rice that i always really enjoyed. I think this is a tasty blend, but it’s not quite the verdant blend that i want it to be. However, i would totally pick this up on it’s own merits for a different sort of taste experience :)Final count: 100 (since even if i have more tea tonight, not time to log until tomorrow)', 'This might actually be more chocolatey than the original Verdant blend. Thanks to <strong>Zennenn</strong> for including this in my Secret Pumpkin package!It’s been a long and difficult week so I needed something sweet and comforting. This did hit the spot, but happens to be one of those black teas that hurt my stomach. Call it a bittersweet experience. The flavor is really nice though. More hot cocoa than rice krispy treats. I’m on my second steep and it is still sweet and flavorful. Yum.', 'Another very well blended tea from LP. Flavored teas can be totally awesome when made with quality ingredients, and this one is certainly an example of such. The dry leaf smells like a bar of good chocolate. Once it’s brewed, I smell more of the maltiness from the black/dark oolong base.My first steep was about 2.5min, and yielded a wonderful cup of tea. It was malty and honey tasting with a pleasantly light chocolate finish. Going into this one, I was afraid that the chocolate I smelled so heavily on the dry leaf would dominate the flavor, basically giving me hot chocolate. Thankfully that was not the case. As the cup cooled, I started to pick up a subdued flavor of dark fruit – I’m thinking maybe currant but it was hard to tell.Next steep was 3m. The chocolate taste was a bit lighter but certainly still around. It mixed with a toasty/roasty note to make this steep taste like friggin chocolate cookies. It was nuts. Very tasty. I still got a bit of that fruitiness as it cooled.I pulled two more steeps out of this tea, with times of 5m and 12m.

It was very much a cup of tea for pensive reflection and engulfing yourself in the surrounding environment.It’s been raining heavily all week, and is expected to do so for the rest of the week as well and while my roommates are heavily complaining about the rain I’ve been loving every second of it. At the very least, I’ve been hanging out in the living with the balcony door open just listening to the pitter patter and soaking in the smell of the petrichor.However, this morning I was actually on the balcony during the storm with a hot cup of tea, and Eilert behind the gate with a bowl of spinach just soaking everything in and enjoying it all. My roommate Cathryn got up to make breakfast/head to class and saw me out on the balcony – and of course I had my laptop propped right inside the balcony door so it couldn’t get wet and I could listen to my obligatory music whilst enjoying my cup of tea. It just heavily tied into the overall mood and aesthetic of not just the cup of tea but the rain storm as well.Today’s song pairing was this one: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G10fjK9bUJk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G10fjK9bUJk</a>But holy shit, I didn’t expect it to lead into the conversation that I wound up having with Cathryn. She very happily came outside to tell me that “I know that song!”. Which, honestly, kind of excited me too ’cause we have such different tastes in music. So, this was a rare occurrence.“Yeah, isn’t Fleetwood Mac great? I mean, I’m especially partial to this song but they’re just great in general”. This got a very puzzled look from her.“No, it’s a Dixie Chicks song. I should know, I just went to their concert over the weekend. It’s one of my favourites and they sang it there. But yeah, this is a decent cover I guess…”“No, Cathryn, this is the original. The Dixie Chicks version is the cover…”“I’m running late for class – so I’ll just let you have this one.”“But… I’m right…?”So that was a thing that happened this morning. I’ll admit that it made me feel quite old; and Cathryn and I only have two years of age difference in the first place. Well, we <em>almost</em> agreed on something music based.

When tasting the first brew, most of what I was tasting was maple, and a sort of grain like or whole wheat flavor, as well as a sour, fruit like note. To my disappointment though, no mushrooms. Happily, they made an appearance in subsequent steeps, a little in the flavor, but more so in the savoury aftertaste. There’s a slight a stringency and bitterness, but it’s mild. By the third, ah! There’s the chocolate notes, and the fruit notes remain. It just gets more savoury as it goes, as the mushrooms and wood flavors really come out to play. I think I love these mushrooms!

I was at work all day and I didn’t get home until late, so unfortunately I didn’t get the chance to try any of my new teas last night. But today! Today is a good day for tasting. Let’s do this.In the bag, the dry leaf smells intense and sweet like maple candies. The sweetness is offset by the deep, resounding aroma of mushroom, earth, bread, and wood—much like a shu. This makes me think it might do really well blended with a shu puerh. Followed the western brewing instructions, though I would like to gong fu this later. This tea tastes like maple syrup, brown sugar, mushrooms, wet wood, and cocoa. There’s a bready note that makes me think of sourdough rolls or pancakes. It’s also slightly tart, like stone fruits—plums, raisins, cherries. The finish is oaky and a little drying. It leaves a malty coating on my tongue along with the taste of maple. I didn’t find the blend overly sweet. The maple flavors are balanced nicely with earthy, woodsy qualities that keep it grounded. The base tea notes come through MUCH more strongly in the second steep. Maple is ever present in the background, but at the forefront you have grain, malt, dark chocolate, and cherries. The natural sweetness of the tea makes itself known. It’s clearly identifiable as the base tea for GO. It’s almost like fudge, and it’s so delicious. The finish here is juicy and sweet. Still slightly drying, with a taste like wood, but it’s drying in a way that makes your mouth water.Gosh. I’m so glad I was able to pick some of this up. I don’t think it’s something I could drink all day, but it’s definitely good.

The smell of the brewed tea is that of a light camp fire with a lot of sweetness, but its taste is only mildly smoky.

My glass mug is still steaming furiously, but I keep trying to steal a sip anyway. I’m impatient. I still love this tea. It’s such a complex and summery thing.We’ve been having a pot of tea every night, since I always have at least one person hanging out at my place these days. Previously, I’ve been blending my teas and not logging it because I don’t really like making pages for custom blends. But I’ve been mostly making “fall” teas. Apple cranberry, vanilla assam, stuff like that…', 'Backlogging. I’ve got a few early-morning classes this semester, and I’ve been taking tea in my Thermos, which is a lovely way to stay warm in the frigid lecture room. I love that it’s still hot when I pull it out of my bag at the end of a 6-hour kitchen lab.This Darjeeling is great, but 5:30am is not when I should be making a pot of tea, apparently. I had it in my head that this was an oolong. I steeped it as an oolong, and I expected it to taste like an oolong. I blame it on Adagio’s Ooooh Darjeeling…. Somehow.

I’ll write more in detail later, but I wanted to get some quick notes down to remember the taste experience. Deep, warm, woody (not woodsy, not smoky) comforting flavor with a tasteful floral note. A slight astringency that I wouldn’t even call “astringent”; more just <strong>good.</strong> I am suitably impressed!Edit a few hours later:Soooo… I realized in retrospect that I may have goofed this tea. I poured it out of its (neat little!) sample bag into a tea tin that had JUST previously been home to some masala chai. I had rinsed the inside of the tea tin out, but unless this tea smells a LOT like chai, I didn’t rinse the aroma out.Since the chai aroma still lingered, I don’t know how much that would have affected the taste. I didn’t really taste chai; I just tasted a combination of a dark, comforting base (which could possibly have been influenced by the chai) and floral notes. One thing I will say for it is that if it wasn’t labeled as a black tea, I would not have guessed it as such; the leaves look like “green tea” leaves (well, they’re green at least, which doesn’t necessarily mean anything), the liquor is a much lighter color than many classic black teas, and the taste is more plant-y than… well, at least the other black teas I’ve tried.

There was no bitterness or astringency. I let it steep another min. <strong>4-min</strong>: A very smooth, medium-bodied black tea. There was no bitterness or astringency. I let it steep another min. <strong>5-min</strong>: A very smooth, oh, so smooth, rich muscatel black tea. This is not as robust as a full-bodied Assam or Keemun, but you wouldn’t expect it to be as it is a Darjeeling! The muscatel white grape flavor lingers long on the tongue gently dancing – like butterflies flitting around on a cluster of blooms. There was zero bitterness or astringency. Oh, this is good! It brings a smile to my face – literally!<strong>Re-Steeping</strong>:  <strong>6-min</strong>: Smooth &amp; light-bodied w/o bitterness or astringency. I let it steep for another 4 min. <strong>10-min</strong>: Smooth light-bodied w/o bitterness or astringency.<strong>Impression</strong>: A very smooth, rich, and highly enjoyable organic Darjeeling with a potent natural muscatel aroma and flavor.

Brewed in a ceramic tea pot or in a paper filter bag.As I’ve previously stated before, I love masala chai and exploring unique blends. I’m a lover of ginger, and I appreciate the fact that the ginger Brenden uses in his blends is stronger than what I’ve encountered in teas from other companies. But the ginger in this case overpowers all of the other ingredients, both the base tea and the spices. Just barely I can taste the vanilla bean and the chocolately goodness from the black Bi Luo Chun (I’m a fan of his Golden Snail). And I did try to shake up the pouch.It’s hard to fully comment every aspect. Nevertheless, this makes an excellent autumn tea. It is very comforting. I do recommend it for those who are curious or want a different masala chai.

When my cup is hot, I get a ton of clove and some cardamon to back it up. There is a little malt in the back of the taste that comes out a little more as the cup cools. It has an overall hearty taste and is well balanced. I’m having it without any additions, but would love to try a cup with some cream. Adding cream… it seems to dampen the flavors a little. The malt is dampened, but it does have a sweeter creamier taste overall. I think I prefer it straight. I had my first cup yesterday in class and the caffeine level seemed to go a good job of getting me through the day. Overall I really like this tea!', 'Sipdown! I’ve had a reasonably bad cold since Thursday evening, so I’ve mostly been drinking comforting teas that I’m familiar with. There’s no point trying something new when I can’t taste it, after all.

In ordering this chai, I was hoping for a chai that didn’t need milk and sugar, since those are off limits for the time being. This fit the bill perfectly.

There are a lot of crushed spices mixed in with the base tea, though I don’t actually see any pieces of vanilla bean.

Oof, the cardamon is strong with this one! A little too strong for me, as I don’t add sugar or milk to my teas. The clove is fairly strong here too, though I don’t mind that as much. I can taste perhaps a tiny bit of vanilla? And it’s a shame, the strong spicing is drowning out the base tea for me, which I know to be quite tasty.

Soooo, next time, I’m going to add more leaf and skip the milk. The spices are delicious, though. Very spicy and nicely balanced. I just want that base tea to come through more. I also got a buttery taste which was interesting. I’ll reserve final judgement until next time!', 'I snagged this one from the last round of the ’Here’s Hoping’ teabox. I had pumpkin pie for breakfast and I really think CHAI goes with pumpkin pie. This particular blend contains the golden snails that I tried before: a light sweet potato flavor. Not the deepest darkest chai, but sometimes it’s nice for a change. I love the mix of spices in this one and it’s the perfect balance. Sweet potato base with just the right spices. I like that this one has the vanilla beans (the occasional crunch in my teeth) and also the holy basil to give it a little bit of a vegetal flavor. The second steep was just as spicy.

I was craving this at work yesterday but instead had my standard Cold 911 for my lungs/allergies lol, so on this dreary, gray Saturday morning, I am cozying up with my cup of this chai.The dry smell is very spicy, lots of pepper, some cardamom, ginger, a very lovely spiced chai smell. It opens the sinuses and invigorates. I followed WP’s steeping directions, at around 205 degrees for 3 minutes. The resulting liquor is a reddish brown in color, and the vanilla that Brenden does so well is present in the aroma, along with the mingling of spices, smoothed by the vanilla and the base. I have never had the Golden Snails Yunnan by itself (or fondly known as Snaily Yums on here I think lol), but I should try it out, as I love Yunnan black teas.As for the flavor…mmm, this is quite a good chai. The flavors meld seamlessly – The spices at the forefront, the honeyed/malty base in the middle blending into a rich vanilla aftertaste, with the spices still kicking around. I can’t really pick out specific spices, which I find to be the mark of a great chai, not one overpowers the other. They instead blend into a spicy and warming concoction. The vanilla really adds the final touch, with it’s sweetness, it just smooths out the sip and leaves you wanting to have another drink, and another…yeah, it’s pretty good. The flavor profile, if my memory serves me correctly, reminds me of Verdant’s Laoshan Village Chai, but instead of a chocolatey base, this one has a more honeyed flavor from the Snails, and the vanilla is richer and more prominent here I think.Overall, this is a delicious cup of yuminess, and I like that it is different from the other chais I have in my cupboard (enter Yu Lu Yan Chai haha). It is a more mellow chai, for cozy fall days, and I might keep it in my cupboard to contrast with the bold Yu Lu Yan Chai, which still might hold my heart for favorite chai, but we will see, this one is not too far behind!

I wonder how plain bi-luo chun black tastes?\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Butter, Cardamon, Ginger, Vanilla\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Oh My, So smooth and creamy almost buttery even,mmmmm. Very nice and bold with malty, cocoa notes and honey notes with smooth floral vanilla and just the right amount of spice. The spice level on this one is just perfect.I can’t believe how smooth and creamy this one is, it needs no milk or sweetener at all because it is perfect on its own. I did decide to add a little maple syrup to it just because and it was omg so delicious BUT a bit much for me at first because I used a bit too much the first time. After using less maple the second time around it was perfection.The maple made it very sweet and even more creamy somehow, the maple sweetness brought about a chocolatey note that is different than the dark chocolatey notes of some of brendens teas and it totally enhanced the Vanilla and made it stand out much more. The chocolatey notes of this one with sweetener is like a milk chocolate donut or something, omg so good. Milk chocolate donut with chai spice on top, mmmmmmm so good.The perfect balance of the ginger and other spices toned down by the vanilla make this a perfect chai on its own and allow it to be subtly sweetened without being too bold like some chais, Some sweet chais give my a slight belly ache from the sweet spicy combo, Not this one!Totally Awesome on it’s own but if ya sweeten it do try some Maple Syrup, oh my so good.Thanks BOYCHIK for mentioning Maple Syrup in your review!

It’s bold enough to stand up to breakfast, but still has a complex and defined flavor profile. Plus, did I mention this chai requires no milk or sweetener? I actually prefer it au naturel. That’s how good it is! Of course, starting with a Golden Snail base, how could it not be? The leaves are the aforementioned adorable snailies plus some spicy chunks :). It just smells warm to me, with ginger definitely coming through as it brews up a golden brown liquor. In the initial sips, ginger is definitely the star. It’s bold without being offensive in any way. Underneath that, buttery baked bread and cardamom really come through in a taste that is extremely close to cardamom rolls (those are a Norwegian thing: kind of like cinnamon rolls but breadier and with cardamom – duh – and savory instead of sweet). As it cools, more the chocolate and honey notes come out to play and the tea becomes much sweeter and more buttery. Yum! If you have the self control to let it cool for a while before drinking (I usually don’t), you will be rewarded with the full flavor profile this delicious tea has to offer.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Baked Bread, Butter, Cardamon, Chocolate, Ginger, Honey\\n</div>', 'So…our little Snaily has a new playground: spice!Chai lovers of this world, this is something to try.I like that this is pretty traditional and not too over the top. Chai blends are often too busy or not enough. This one is an excellent example a true balance.But there are many other decent chai blends out there…What makes this one special?\\nVanilla beans and Golden Snail.The naturally creamy base tea paired with the vanilla bean soften greatly all those spices. They are usually bitter when you don’t add milk or sugar. But here, you end up with a dessert-like cup of spicy honeyed goodness, without having to add anything.And the beauty of this blend is that I can taste all the spices…ginger, cinnamon, clove and cardamom. Add to that the buttery taste of the base tea, and you have something reminiscent of grandma’s apple pie.Today, we had thundershowers all day. Grey sky, cool temperature. Thought it was the perfect day to try this for the first time.But the next time I have it will be on a hot day, cold brewed in almond milk with a little maple syrup…mmmm.', 'Finally I got my WP. I was so excited to try this particular blend. It’s new and sounded dreamy from the description. And it is . This chai is very smooth, spices are balanced and so fresh. It is strong.

I have a keen sense of smell and I swear I caught a buzz haha. After a moment’s deliberation this is the one I chose to try first.It is smooth, smooth, silky smooth. It opens with notes of sweet vanilla and evergreen trees. There’s the gentle touch of warm spices, like a lover’s fingers on the back of your hand. It’s light and soothing; perfectly balanced. The texture of the liquid is velvety. After the spice I notice a buttery, honeyed flavor coming from the base tea. (I think the comparison to chocolate-filled croissants is appropriate here.) It’s like flaky, buttery croissants kissed by chocolate malt! It’s not an overwhelming flavor—it melds with everything else very nicely—but it washes over your tongue with honey, malt and baked goodness. Seriously, soooo good. I rushed to make another cup as soon as the first was empty. For me, resteep value is a good indicator of quality chai. (If the second steep of any tea doesn’t compare to the first, it seems a waste.)Aaaand it’s still as good as the first cup! I’m in HEAVEN! Melting butter, stronger chocolate notes, vanilla and honey, spice still there! I love this! It’s wonderfully balanced. It’s everything I want, everything I need in a chai.

A local museum has the cast of the first rex skeleton ever discovered and I knew it had something to do with Kansas but couldn’t remember what and told him I would email him the details later. Turns out the discoverer was from Kansas, and I could have put that in the email and called it a day but noooo, see he asked about Paleontology and that is the most dangerous thing to ask me about. So Ben’s poor grandfather just received a massive email about all of Kansas’s Paleontological history, details about the Permian-Triassic Extinction Event (Because I will always talk about the Great Dying given the slightest chance) the best place for fossils to form and how location effects the fossil record. I have a feeling no one in Ben’s family will ever ask me about dinosaurs again, the same thing happened last time someone asked me about tea, at least I left them with a nice nugget of information!Today’s tea is one that never sticks around in my stash very long, a long time favorite, Sun Moon Lake Tea (#18 Red Jade) this one from Golden Tea Leaf. One of the reasons this is one of my favorites is each one I have had is different, it is fascinating, you can certainly tell they are all Red Jades, but they each have some wildly different but similar note, kinda like the difference between different kinds of chocolate. Some are sassafrasy, some like cherry, some menthol, some cinnamon…it is always an adventure with this tea. Notes of cloves, dried cherries, freshly cut tomatoes, sassafras, malt, and finish of woodiness and molasses waft from the pile of leaves. It is both sharp and sweet, almost tingly in my nose, and of course I love the sassafras note. I did find the tomato note to be very surprising, I have run into many red teas that have either tomato leaves or sun dried tomatoes as a note, but this is the first time I have smelled one where it is like someone handed me a fresh from the garden just sliced Roma.I decided since the tea is named (among many things) Red Jade to use my red rice pattern set, it seemed fitting. After the first steeping the leaves are so potent, practically exploding with intense aroma, notes of cloves, menthol, and sassafras just wash over me, it is wonderful and invigorating. After this initial flood of intense notes, gentle notes of malt and chestnut with a very gentle tomato quality greet my nose. The liquid is intense as well, strong cloves and sassafras, only a gentle sweetness with a burst of menthol in the middle and a finish of strong tomatoes, it is very strong and brisk.On the first sip I was surprised by a burst of sweetness, this tea is usually quite sweet in taste and aroma, but with the aroma this time around being less focused on malty honey sweetness I expected the taste to be more brisk than sweet. The mouthfeel is pleasantly tingly and smooth, it seems a contradiction, but it works really well. Strong notes of sassafras and menthol at the front with a building menthol in the middle, towards the end a savory tomato note pops up and then finished with a cinnamon honey note that lingers for quite a while.This steep has evolved into something new and exciting! Less sweet and more intense, a starting note of dark chocolate and saffron with a cardamon finish. New idea, one day make a Red Jade Masala Chai…assuming I can convince myself to add milk and sugar, the idea seems heinous. The end of this tea is where the sweetness lies, along with the cloves and sassafras, both lingering into the aftertaste. I was seriously in love with the saffron note, anytime a tea has that naturally (and not from added saffron) it immediately jumps to the top of my favorites list.The third steep might be my favorite, ramping up the sweetness to be more like the first, so it is dripping with honey and caramelized sugar. Then of course is a rich cocoa and saffron, a nice tingly burst of cloves and sassafras in the middle with a distant wisp of tomato. The finish brings in a mellow cinnamon that lingers into the aftertaste. Of course since this is a Red Jade I am going to push this tea until there is nothing left, which came around steep seven, so it has decent longevity.For blog and photos: <a href=\"http://ramblingbutterflythoughts.blogspot.com/2016/10/golden-tea-leaf-sun-moon-lake-tea-18.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://ramblingbutterflythoughts.blogspot.com/2016/10/golden-tea-leaf-sun-moon-lake-tea-18.html</a>', 'Warming me inside out! what a nice tea.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Caramel, Cinnamon\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'The Sun Moon Lake Black Tea tastes mellow. ok. now that I have spent some time with this tea.

Once you open the punch you’re blasted with sweet smelling flowers and a soft woodiness. The leaves are darker than the first flush, but they every bit as tippy. You can easily spot multiple platinum tips in a handful of this sweet smelling leaf. I poured a heavy amount in my tetsubin and brewed away. The steeped leaves are still sweet, but they carry a wet wood roughness and a tangy maple aroma. The brew is thick and dark red. The initial sip begins with some smooth oak and moves into a walnut nuttiness. The drink finishes with a thick muscatel and some dark fruit in the background. This is a heavy muscatel toned beverage. I enjoy brewing this later in the day, so I may sit and unwind and pay attention to the transition of the flavors. It’s enjoying as how it begins almost rough and “bitey”, and then it softens and curbs the palette. This a great example of what a fine Darjeeling should taste like.

Malty, nutty, with a hint of honey. Based on reading reviews of their other teas, it seems like this one has a much subtler flavoring.

Nice!', 'I got some mail today from Auggy and I did a dork-out dance by the mailbox. The first thing I did upon reaching my desk was find the almond cookie and get it started while I caught up on what I missed earlier today.It’s raining again today, which has painted a gloomy background for the day’s activities. This is going to be a tea that begs me to be imbibed during any form of precipitation, because it is super comforting. But also, to be imbibed on most days.I mean, let’s begin with the smell, shall we?OM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM.I think that pretty much sums it up, but in the interest of fairness to the tea, I’ll elaborate a bit more. It smells like almonds. And cookies. Almonds and cookies. Maybe even almond cookies? [I know, OF ALL THE COINCIDENCES! But also, sometimes mint and chocolate. I’m not sure where I’m getting that from; maybe it’s the plastic bag.

Again.OM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM NOM.That’s like, three more noms.The magic of this tea happens for me in the aftertaste. Letting it sit on the tongue brings out that dry spiciness that cinnamon gives you, and there’s not much else that I derive from it from the actual liquid taste itself. But after the first swallow, I was like, “Oooooh! There it is. COOKIES!”The almond taste is there, and I get a little puff of the cinnamon. The base is reminiscent of a sugar cookie, but not quite as sweet. [Hah, clearly trying to avoid the now infamous “bake-y” here. Sometimes I tasted almond croissant, too. All in all, there is no way that trying this isn’t going to result in an order.Because, really, if a tea can trick me into thinking that I just ate a cookie, I’m all for it.', 'I so love this tea.

Auggy, you just brightened my day by twofold just by allowing me to taste the amazingness that is this cup of tea.First off, the try tea is gorgeous. All sorts of browns and russets, mixed in with the eye-catching orange-red safflower blossoms. Nice slivers of almonds and a smell to die for. Seriously. I’ve actually been saving this tea since Auggy sent it to me, because I had a feeling that I would fall in love with it. And I’m one of those save-the-best-for-last kind of girls.The leaves did a little dance (but not by much, really, since they’re kinda tiny), and I had a cup of absolutely amazing smelling tea in front of me. Seriously. This smells buttery and bake-y and almond-y and cookie-like. There’s the cinnamon mingling with a tea smell and the entire thing really does smell like an ALMOND COOKIE. Well, that would explain the name, then, right?First sip gave me a little shiver of happiness. MMMMMM. You get the tang of the tea, followed by the sweetness of the cinnamon, which then mingles into the almonds. And somehow, on the swallow, this produces an amazing likeness to almond cookies. I don’t know if any of you shop at Italian bakeries, but if you do, try the pignoli nut cookies. They’re made with pine nuts (aka pignoli in Italian) and the cookie itself is made with almond paste. They’re soft and chewy and delicious. Sweeter than marzipan and sugary, with the absolutely amazing taste of pine nuts. I grew up eating them. They’re the epitome of an awesome almond cookie, and this tea really just brings all those feelings to the surface.The flavor dynamics and balance here are absolute perfection. I really couldn’t ask for a better-tasting cup, especially after my very bizarre experience with lapsang souchong this morning. Yay for delicious dessert tea! And yay for Auggy and her wonderful samples!', 'This is more like it.

It’s really the only one I could see myself missing when it’s gone, but fortunately I won’t have to because American Tea Room’s Brioche does an even better job with a similar flavor.

I love this tea. It is especially good “Latte” – I warm the milk and then froth it foamy, and top it with a grind of fresh nutmeg.

I’m sure that some of you who may stumble across this review know the tremendous sense of relief that comes with catching up all of your work. Part of what kept me from reviewing this tea sooner was that I made a point of trying to really savor it. I also pushed myself to see how it reacted to multiple methods of preparation.I brewed this tea both Western and gongfu. I actually tried two different Western preparations. One was a one step preparation in which I steeped approximately 3-4 grams of loose tea leaves in around 8 ounces of 205 F water for 5 minutes. The other method was a three step infusion in which I steeped 3 grams of loose tea leaves in 8 ounces of 205 F water for 3 minutes and then followed that up with 5 and 7 minute infusions. For the gongfu session, I steeped 6 grams of loose tea leaves in 4 ounces of 205 F water for 5 seconds following a quick rinse. This infusion was followed by 12 additional infusions. Steep times for these infusions were as follows: 7 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 1 minute, 1 minute 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes. This review will primarily detail the results of the gongfu session, though I will undoubtedly comment on the other preparations at some point.Prior to the rinse, I noted that the dry tea leaves emitted pleasant aromas of dark chocolate and malt. After the rinse, I noted more pronounced aromas of dark chocolate and malt accompanied by hints of brown sugar and orange. The first infusion produced a similar, albeit slightly more integrated aroma. The mouth was dominated by dark chocolate, though I could detect impressions of sorghum molasses, malt, brown sugar, and wood just beneath the heavy chocolate flavor. Subsequent infusions introduced a fruitiness and creaminess on the nose and in the mouth. The dark chocolate, brown sugar, malt, wood, and sorghum were joined by impressions of cream, orange peel, and black cherry. Later infusions emphasized the wood, malt, and cream impressions, though traces of orange peel, sorghum, and dark chocolate remained. I noted that a slight mineral presence emerged both on the nose and in the mouth, as did a somewhat distant impression of black walnut.While the gongfu session presented a very elegant, layered tea that revealed its charms over time, the Western infusions predictably produced a more balanced tea liquor overall. The one step infusion emphasized the tea’s woodier, more tannic qualities and presented a more astringent brew that nevertheless revealed strong notes of orange peel, wood, malt, cream, and dark chocolate. The three step infusion moved from heavy dark chocolate, wood, and malt presences during the first infusion to a sweeter, fruitier cup full of brown sugar, cream, orange, and black cherry notes during the second infusion. The third infusion presented a mildly malty, creamy liquor with wood, chocolate, fruit, and mineral underpinnings.In the end, I was very pleased with this tea. I found it to be very sophisticated, yet also very approachable. While I do wish it had a little more bite, I think fans of smooth, nuanced black teas will find a lot to love about this one. I would have no problem recommending this tea to anyone searching for a high quality Chinese black tea with plenty of character.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Brown Sugar, Cherry, Cream, Dark Chocolate, Malt, Mineral, Molasses, Orange, Walnut, Wood\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'I’ve decided to up my rating on this tea.

The taste is malty, baked-goods-esque, with quite a luscious feel and a hint of cocoa.

And boy did it live up to those expectations.The flavors are simply amazing. I must say that this is, so far in my novice tea-tasting, the best I have ever had. It’s creamy and, like the scent, woody. I also taste a bit of a chocolate-y flavor. I am very impressed as a first-time customer of Whispering Pines. There is just this overwhelmingly good flavor I can’t describe. It’s slightly flowery, woody, mossy, chocolate-y. Very creamy, silky feel. This tea is not bitter or astringent at all.Overall: Silky, creamy feeling with an intense and complex flavor, which I may or may not think for being a novice. Chocolate hints and sweet notes, but also very woody and flowery. Very impressed.Second Infusion — Five MinutesThe scent is similar to the first infusion, though it somehow leaves a cooling sensation in my throat. I was intensely curious about how the flavor would change, but I was feeling slightly full from the first 8oz of water.The tea takes on a more subtle flavor, reminding me more of malt this time around. Slightly milky too, and just as creamy. It’s not as pleasurable as the first infusion, but it is definitely tasty and palatable, very good. More of a tea flavor this time too.Overall: Still silky, creamy, with a more subdued flavor that is slightly malty and milky but not quite as pleasurable, for me anyway, as the first infusion.I was too full to do a third infusion, though! I’d love to have tried it again, but my stomach wasn’t cooperating nearing the end of the second cup. However, I’d have to say that this was an awesome experience and a very good first buy from Whispering Pines.

It has such a long name, lol. Anyway, I haven’t been doing many reviews lately because I feel kind of intimidated by everyone else’s eloquent reviews and kind of powerless to articulate what it is that I’m tasting in the tea. But I guess I’ll never get better without practicing . . .I think this is the first real high-quality Darjeeling I’ve tried (most of the samples I’ve gotten over the past months have been Chinese tea) and I was worried I wouldn’t like the difference in flavor but apparently I really do. It somehow manages to be floral without being too astringent, and it’s great on its own or with milk and sugar. I didn’t steep it as long as recommended because it reached desired strength before that, which means it’ll probably be great for several steepings (though I haven’t got there yet). Of course, I don’t know how representative this is of other Darjeelings, so I guess I’ll have to look around for some more samples so I can compare them all. Thanks for sharing, JK7ray! :)Now I just wish my neighbors would stop singing “eeeee” in such a pained tone of voice. I mean, what possible purpose can that serve? If it’s so important to sing “eeeee,” at least try to sound happy about it.

Basically as soon as you start paying attention to it, <strong>poof</strong> it is still, relaxed, and croaking contentedly. Basically I lack anything interesting to say and do not feel like complaining about my meds. So here, frog dance time!It is time for my weekly coverage of a new tea from What-Cha, specifically Darjeeling Autumn Flush 2014 Gopaldhara Red Thunder Gold Black Tea, in honor of the steaming bowl of Jaipur Karhi I have sitting next to me, the most superior of canned curries, for those lazy days. This is a unique Darjeeling, not only is it plucked late in the year (hello Autumn Flush) it is grown at a high elevation, meaning it gets frosted over which causes the tea to wilt, starting the oxidation process while the leaves are still attached to the tea plant. This tea is only produced in limited quantities, this particular batch is more tippy than most, giving it more of that fuzzy gold that I adore. The aroma of these thunderous leaves (also apropos since we are under a perpetual flood and thunderstorm warning as of late) is soooo intense, would have knocked me off my feet I was not already sitting down. Very strong notes of roasted peanuts and acorn squash, then the intensity mellows out and notes of raisins, spicebush, black walnut shells, and lastly a delicate hint of sandalwood at the finish. This is a super aromatic tea, so be prepared!Into ye old steeping apparatus the leaves go, and by steeping apparatus I mean lidless yixing teapot I use for later flush Darjeeling tea. Because why not? The aroma of the dark leaves is so sweet, strong notes of raisins and roasted peanuts with a distinctly floral and woody sandalwood finish. The liquid is heady without being floral (apparently that is a thing, or at least I perceive it so) strong sweet notes of yams, raisins, roasted peanuts and a finish of acorn squash. Yum.Oh MAN this tea is freaking delicious! It is intensely rich and heavy, with a creamy mouth feel and a tiny hint of drying at the finish. The taste starts out as a not too sweet blend of loam, roasted peanuts, and squash, this transitions to a more sweet taste profile of squash blossoms (not something I run into often) raisins, and lily flowers. The finish is a malty blend of raisins and sandalwood, giving it a lingering aromatic aftertaste. Me thinks I am going to need this tea as a staple in my tea stash!For blog and photos:  <a href=\"http://ramblingbutterflythoughts.blogspot.com/2015/06/what-cha-darjeeling-autumn-flush-2014.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">http://ramblingbutterflythoughts.blogspot.com/2015/06/what-cha-darjeeling-autumn-flush-2014.html</a>', 'The dry leaves in a warm gaiwan smell nutty with a hint of cocoa. After the first infusion, the wet leaves smell like flowers and apples, just a touch of cocoa at the end.The first infusion is really sweet and honey-like. There’s a hint of white grape and maybe orange. It’s subtle and smooth. The second infusion is much more floral tasting than the first, with a hint of the lingering white grape flavor as before. What’s really interesting about this tea is that it doesn’t taste like tea to me… It tastes like water sweetened with honey and infused with fruit. It’s kind of unique in that way. It is very clean and light, quite easy to drink.I did a few infusions with this, brewing a bit longer each time. Even if I brewed it really long the flavor never became overpowering.. It was always floral, slightly fruity, not bitter at all.What-Cha’s description says it reminds of red wine.

A lot of smoke is very good’ philosphy when it comes to tea here. A closer look at the site makes me think that this is actually just the standard. They have an organic version too as well as a Yin Jun Mei Souchong, which I’m desperate to try but the $22.30 for 50g made me decide that I could live with waiting a little longer with that.The leaf aroma is certainly smoke! It’s got a kind of ancient spicy note to it too, but it’s primarily smoke. Sticking my nose into that tin is a bit like walking into a house that’s been on fire. Not a harsh smell of smoke, really, but a heavy one.It’s the same story in the cup. It’s very prickly in its smokyness, but the spicy note is much more pronounced here. I’m reminded of pipe tobacco for some reason, in spite of the fact that it’s more than 20 years since I’ve known anybody who smoked a pipe.Aroma-wise this one seems much harsher than A.C. Perch’s LS which is generally my stable LS.WHEW! They have not been skimpy with the smoke on the flavour! It’s not as harsh a flavour as the aroma would lead me to believe though. There’s just more of it. It’s rounded out very nicely. Even bits of my mouth that hasn’t even touched the tea itself yet can pick up the smoke flavour.There is supposed to be the sweet note also, which I’ve just learned from TeaSpring’s info is supposedly a note of a sweet chinese fruit called longan. I didn’t know that. Interesting. Now I want to try and eat one. Anyway, it’s supposed to be there, but TeaSpring’s info also says that the smoke is so strong in this one that it doesn’t come out until later steeps. With the volume of smoke here, I agree!However, I do still feel like I can pick up some underlying sweetness. Sirup-y and thick but very very faint. At this point on the first steep it’s more like the promise of that note rather than anything else.The overall impression here is something thick and smooth with a heavy cover of prickly smoke.This is indeed a VERY good LS and it makes my usual A.C.

This was one of my first purchases from Whispering Pines Tea Company and I totally forgot I still had it. At first, I was a little concerned about the tea’s age, but after opening the pouch and catching a whiff of ridiculously herbal, woody tea leaves, my concern melted away. I found this tea to be an exceptionally balanced black tea with enough depth and complexity to keep one coming back for more.I prepared this tea gongfu style. After a quick rinse, I steeped 6 grams of loose tea leaves in 4 ounces of 205 F water for 5 seconds. This infusion was chased by 14 additional infusions. Steep times for these infusions were as follows: 7 seconds, 10 seconds, 15 seconds, 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 30 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds, 1 minute, 1 minute 15 seconds, 1 minute 30 seconds, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, and 5 minutes.Prior to the rinse, the dry tea leaves emitted aromas of malt, wood, roasted nuts, spice, and molasses. After the rinse, I began to catch hints of citrus, camphor, sweet potato, and leather. The first infusion produced an almost identical bouquet. In the mouth, I detected a mix of wood, nuts, leather, and malt underscored by hints of citrus, camphor, sweet potato, molasses, and spice. Subsequent infusions allowed the nut impressions to more clearly define themselves. They reminded me of a combination of roasted almond, roasted chestnut, and beechnut. The sweet potato, camphor, and molasses notes strengthened slightly, joined by notes of caramel, butter, pine, smoke, honey, minerals, and dark chocolate. The indistinct citrus impressions morphed into a clear orange presence, while the melange of spices also came into focus, resembling a mix of anise, black licorice, ginger, cinnamon, and black pepper. The later infusions were clean and smooth on the nose and in the mouth. I detected mild notes of malt, butter, leather, roasted nuts, and minerals underscored by lingering citrus, spice, pine, camphor, and honey tones.Overall, this was an exceptionally refined Yunnan black tea. I could see what all the fuss was about and only wish that I had gotten to this one a little sooner. I guess that just means I’ll have to pick up a pouch of the 2017 harvest at some point in the near future.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Almond, Anise, Black Pepper, Butter, Camphor, Chestnut, Cinnamon, Dark Chocolate, Ginger, Honey, Leather, Licorice, Malt, Mineral, Molasses, Orange, Pine, Roasted nuts, Smoke, Sweet Potatoes, Wood\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'I received this as a sample from Whispering Pines and loved the tea.

I may have under rated it.', 'I had a feeling I knew what to expect here—something similar to what I enjoy so much about say, Persimmon Tree Vintage Black, that classic memory-inducing brisk-black-done-well experience—and I wasn’t let down, though I was in for some surprises. This has all those classic elements of briskness and relative astringency done well, but it’s more complex than I anticipated (though maybe I should’ve known, given it’s from Butiki). There’s more flavor interplay going on here than with some of my other go-to comfort CTCs and legacy-style teas, and a lot more fruitiness (which I guess I could’ve expected if I’d, uh, read the copy :). It’s also amazingly fine, the dry particles. It’s a nice unique tea for not being quite so straightforwardly in that classic category, but still being breakfast-y strong and full of pure “old fashioned tea” flavor.As a side note, I’m really enjoying getting my husband to the dark side slowly but surely, muahahaha. I’d already gotten him to switch from his mostly soda-based habit for after-work treat to cold steeped tea, and now that it’s finally cooler and darker here in the afternoon he’s been coming home needing a pick-me-up and we’ve inadvertently found ourselves doing classic afternoon tea all “peckish Lady Bedford-style”—a couple cookies or a leftover biscuit or split sandwich and hot tea before I start working on dinner (his school year schedule’s nuts for our standard lifestyle; he’s up before 5am and eats lunch by 11am, so dinner really ought to be eaten at like, 4pm but come on, that’s just SO culturally early! So this works well—he eats a little something just to tide him over when he gets home at 3 or 4 and then we eat dinner around 6). He’s so busy all the time that I really cherish these moments. He’s visibly restored afterwards too, from so tired and forlorn looking when he comes in the door he can barely stay awake long enough to change out of his work clothes to alert and calmed, ready to start grading and lesson planning.

My neighbor was from Ceylon (Sri Lanka now) and went home for a visit, bringing home a big quantity of very superior tea as a gift for me. I ruined it…not knowing how to properly steep tea. I threw some leaves in a pot, put boiling water in and after awhile drank the tea (never removing the leaves). Of course the tea became bitter right away.IndigoBloom has supplied me with a do-over! The forgiveness of my former tea sin!I do love black tea. Most of the ones I taste are from China, a few from India but none really from Ceylon. This lovely tea was quite vanilla floral and cocoa smelling. There was astringency but no bitterness. Adding sugar and cream inproved the tea and increased the chocolatey malty taste. I didn’t taste or smell raspberry which others have commented on. My response to the tea itself was that it was clear, bright, light with an almost sparkling quality that reminded me of a freshwater spring. I know that sounds strange, but it had a quality of freshness that made it a perfect tea for blending with heavier black tea’s. It was also what makes this tea perfect for iced tea. It was CLEAN tea!Thank’s Indigo-B', 'The Ceylon teas I have tried up to this time (not that many) have been far less interesting to me than the Darjeelings, Assams, Keemun’s and other blacks. This one, however, really intrigues me. The berry notes are present during steeping and after. I liked that, it actually drew me to the cup from arms length at my desk to take it in. It is a little astringent, but that is ok with me. Each sip finishes very clean and sharp. There is a depth to this one that seems familiar, but I am having trouble placing it.

Last year I ordered this tea from Upton’s and they claimed, ‘Due to difficult growing conditions this year in India, this tea has a more intense flavor, which may be tamed with the addition of milk\". I’m paraphrasing, but that was true. This year, I looked to Harney and Sons for my full leaf Assam. When I placed my order in Sept, the 2010 Nahorhabi Estate tea was the only top grade full leaf Assam they had, so I ordered it.My first two cups were tasted on Sat, 10-22-11. I figured it might be less fresh because it was from last years crop. Man was I wrong! The tea was sealed in a foil bag &amp; maintained its freshness. When I opened the bag and inhaled deeply……….BAMM, I was hit with this wonderful, malty, candy sweet Assam! My mouth literally started to water! I took a few minutes to take it all in. In addition, this tippy Assam possessed good chocolate notes as well. I reduced my steep times to 3.5 minutes to compensate for the claim above. After my tea cooled, the cups aroma came through. This medium brown hued cup smelled malty, chocolatey, with a truly natural sweetness. Definitely very malty, chocolate sweetness on the palate, with full, lingering flavor and yet very smooth. I’m not sure about honey notes. Sometimes I’ll add more tea to steeped leaves and resteep using same parameters. Here the tea is still malty, chocolatey and sweet, although more stout (but not bitter). To subdue some of the stoutness, sometimes I’ll add the smallest dash of skim milk, which brings a creaminess to the flavor, without sacrificing taste.This tends to be my Saturday evening tea, which I’ve had each week since that first cup. I could drink this tea every day but I don’t, because I believe special teas like this one should be occasionally savored. I look forward to drinking this one every Saturday night! :))Reviewed: Sunday, 11-20-11.', 'Nahorhabi Full has a wonderful rich and malty taste.

Despite really letting loose on this one – pouring a full boil and even a spoon squeeze of the leaves after 4 minutes, it still brewed strong but with rich yet balanced, enjoyable flavor with some natural honey-like sweetness. This cup epitomizes a deep cup of tea – dark brewed with unmistakable character that declares its quality above many other black teas. The experience is unforgettable enough that I was able to remember the name of the estate and recommend this Assam to others while it is still available.I have enjoyed this tea iced as well in the summer months – brewing it strong in quantity but not increasing steep time. It pairs well with light, sweet citrus.This is currently my preferred Assam, though I have ordered some of the new Mangalam and Satisphur varieties and will testify for those once they arrive.', 'This is a lovely tea.

I’m having problems calling it, because I don’t know how I feel about it. I’m having a love/hate relationship. When it’s HOT, it has as odd fruity, white wine, astringent smell to it. Can’t even begin to describe how it tastes – some might say light and bright – I’m calling it a high note/tone. As it cools, it deepens and the cocoa notes, and the starchy feel that I like so well starts to come through. Once this is lukewarm, it’s a really nice black tea, with all the notes that I love about good Chinese blacks…. I hate this when it’s hot, I love it when it’s cooler. I’ve drank it a couple days at work now. Today I tried it with more leaf, cooler water, less steep time. I didn’t think the “wine” taste was as prominent today, but still there… This just really confuses me.

Well, the Black Beauty qualifies. Unlike other people, I find this to be quite dry and clean in the mouth balanced by a nice burnt sugar taste and an almost chai-like spiciness.

It just sounded so good and it smelled so yummy in the bag. And it was really really good but it was kind of weird too.I don’t know what I was expecting when it came to this tea but I definitely didn’t expect what I got. Dry the tea smells like any other black tea. Maybe a bit roastier. But brewed this tea smells…it’s kind of difficult to describe…but kind of herbaceous. Like basil. Basil in a garden because there is also kind of an earthy smell as well. It smells like my Grandma’s garden….it’s a happy place for me. The taste keeps that basil flavor but adds a chocolaty kick at the end of the sip. It reminds me of my favorite cake ever which happens to be a chocolate basil cake. It sounds weird but it’s pretty much the best thing ever.I’m still brewing this one so updates will be updating. That makes very little sense but it will happen.', 'I got a sample of this tea with my first Mandala order.

Something like chocolate and the smallest tinge of smoke too. Very pleasant and easy-going. I can see the resemblance to keemun and how people might prefer this as it’s a little sweeter and smoother than the keemuns I’ve tried so far but still has hints of those smoky intense chocolate notes.

The liquor was medium gold then deeper gold, clear and vibrant.<strong>Taste and Scent:</strong> There was nothing predictable about this tea. No taste or scent that I could compare it to. This isn’t Laoshan Black or Zhu Rong. Not a cleaver morphing of Golden Fleece either.  To compare one to another would be a type of Tea Blasphemy.I took one small sip of the golden liquor and thought ‘butter’…. Off in a trailing thought…‘butter’…‘butter’….smooth and sweet and then… ‘potato’…and nothing after that.I sat.“What is this tea?” I wondered. There’s no chocolate flavor like the others (comparing the incomparable Verdant Black Tea’s), it’s malty, but not with a maltiness that I’ve ever tasted before.Again I calmed myself, remembering not to rush even though I was excited. This was like opening a gift I’d been waiting for!I poured the second steep and drank again, noticing the fragrance.Sweet Vietnamese Cinnamon with a hint of honeysuckle floral that began to wrap around my head like the ‘Dance of the Sugerplum Fairies’.

It was the buttery caramel, the spun sugar so light that a breath could crack it that drew me in past the doorway.The tea tasted and smelled like that thinnest sweet, buttery spun sugar with a hint of honey. Somehow, the feeling is like the candy commercial on TV where the lady is looking in the window of the store and what you see is the reflection of her as a young girl.I don’t understand how the sweetness, potato, butter, malty, honey, caramel and cinnamon flavors all dance together with such abandon on the lightest of tea toes without a mishap. What a show!This is another exquisite tea!Happy Tea To You! Happy Tea To Me!

This, however, has been on my mind for the past few days, especially after <strong>Indigobloom</strong>`s note on it. I wanted to do this gongfu at first, but I am feeling exceptionally lazy today, maybe because I did a lot of gongfu brewing with my pu’erh yesterday, so I decided to do western. Also, I want to save my leaves, only have 7 g of this :(The dry smell was quite chocolate and yum, reminded me of Laoshan Black. I steeped for 1 minute in boiling water. The wet leaves were BAM, pure honey, I was very pleased. I love honey, had a lovely honey toast for breakfast, so this was very promising.Now for taste..this is pretty delicious. I do get the sweet potato that others have mentioned, and although I am not a huge fan of them (aka NEVER eat them haha) this tea tastes quite delicious. There is a strong honey taste and lots and lots of chocolate, but it’s a different type of chocolate than the Laoshan Black. That one was more rich and decadent, this one is more of a honey sweet chocolate with some grain. Not as much malt, but in the last bit of the sip it definitely is present. This isn’t as thick as other black teas either, more along the lines of the Mi Lan Dancong for mouthfeel. Regardless, this is a darn tasty cup, and now I want to try it gongfu at some point to see what happens to the flavors.I will have a few more cups of this today, going out for bday sushi with friends tonight so don’t want to be too waterlogged, might have to save some steepings for tomorrow.Overall, this is a nice, sweet black tea. Lots of honey and chocolate, yet lighter and a bit different from the other Verdant Black teas. Oh, and I feel the caffeine in this one hehe :) thank you for yet another excellent tea, Verdant!!ETA: I actually enjoyed the latter half of the cup a bit more than the first half, it just zipped down and now I will have to make more. It is even <strong>more</strong> honey, if that is possible, and smoother too? Mmmm ok this is a darn good tea.', 'Finishing a not-too-shabby amount of work today, I decided to stop, probably for the day, put on some Opeth, think about what to make for supper, and try something new tea-wise.Promises of sweet potato, malt, chocolate, and honey notes initially drew me in when I ordered this back in the fall. As soon as I ripped open the packet and took a whiff, the expression on my face must have changed when I smelled sweet smoke. <em>Smoke</em>. Not a favourite note. But it’s not overwhelming. But still, where are the aforementioned notes?This tastes very similar to the smell. Actually, the sweetness is coming out as it cools. There’s the syrupy honey in the background. I appreciate how this lacks astringency. Hmm ok, well out comes the chocolate, but it’s quite dull. Smoky chocolate with an emphasis on <em>smoke</em>.Glad I opted for no more than a sample.', 'After working seven days in a row, I have a day off today, and I couldn’t be happier. I’m spending the morning researching Antonio Vivaldi and listening to some more of the Four Seasons… I feel like a bad musician for not being more familiar with Vivaldi or his most famous work. Baroque-era music is rarely my choice to listen to (I’m a stormy minor-key Romantic by heart), but now that I’m giving it an educated listen, it’s quite lovely.I still really enjoy this tea. It came out very wheat-y today, and that’s growing on me. I’m on infusion 2, and I hope I can get at least another cup out of this (I’m doing it Western style). I’m glad I’ve found some Verdant teas I really like. I feel like I’ll be restocking this.', 'Wow. Wow. WOW. I am floored.  There is sweet potato, chocolate and absolutely no astringency. Like drinking a cloud. A silk one. Dipped in gold? Don’t wanna spend too much time online since I’m at my friends place… but I could not resist logging this asap.Edit: So the second infusion was pretty bland. I almost didn’t drink it but then decided to add a dash of milk and that spruced things up quite a bit.  The third steep however, was great! It had a distinct mineral quality to it, with a warm cinnamon/potato background to it. Very nice.', 'So, I was pretty apprehensive about brewing this tea up as I’d seen (I thought) a few notes about people not being big fans, or about it being quite strong/bitter, etc., but this doesn’t seem to be a problem for me! I was cautious and used about 1.5 tsp in boiling water for 1 minute (the low end of the given parameters, which were 1-2 tsp for 1-2 minutes… I think…) The aroma was reminiscent of Laoshan Black with chocolatey notes, but it’s definitely not quite as intense, and the flavour fits perfectly with this, being chocolatey and malty but less so than Laoshan Black, but also with a bit of… hay-y flavour, aka that flavour that I attribute to bagged blacks. I’d be tempted to call it “Laoshan Black Light” or something to that effect, as that’s how it’s coming off to me.I’m happy to have an ounce of this added to my collection – it will help tide me over until the 2 oz. of Laoshan Black that I ordered last night arrives! (Also, it’s neat to have tried another tea with a cool story behind it!)ETA: Second infusion (2 min) still has chocolatey notes, and more of that “classic black” flavour. Still pretty decent. I’m wavering on going for a third infusion though… getting awfully sick of reinfusing things, haha (I’m sure it would hold up for one more though).', 'I bought this because <strong>Sil</strong> was so excited about it that I was curious to try it as well. Also, I needed to spend $40 for the free shipping to Canada! (I love this policy by the way.)So this tea seems to be the lovechild of Verdant’s Laoshan Black and DAVIDsTEA’s Ceylon Spring. It has honey and chocolate and oats like the LB, yet there’s also CS’s grassy notes present too. It’s almost like a burnt grass, but without being unpleasantly so.Hmm. I love that we can describe things as burnt grass, or earthy, or fishy and in this sense it’s a good thing, but if it were something else I consumed a lot of like steak or cake or carrots, it would be very disappointing.This is good. I’ll keep resteeping is at I’d like to get a better idea of which one I like better – this, or either of its “parents.”', 'Orange is the new black everyone!I am on an orange slice kick again. I added a slice of orange to a cup of this tea. It is a delicious balance of sweet orange, and dark, malty, black tea. It is quite a bit sweeter than usual with the orange mixed in with the natural sweetness of the tea.

Savory and wonderful, like a nourishing bowl of homemade tomato soup (not that nasty stuff that comes in a can) … only better, because it is also tea. It’s like combining two of my favorite comfort foods in one. Now… if somehow chocolate would go well with this, then I’d be in tea heaven.And even though it has been a while since I’ve had this, it still tastes wonderful. I do need to try this with the bacon flavored tea, which means I’m probably going to have to buy more of the bacon flavored tea… and I think that I should also try it with the jalapeno tea just for fun.<strong>LOVE</strong>', 'This is quite peppery today, and I can pick up a hint of smoke and the basil, but am missing out on the tomato, as I think I did last time. It’s probably because there wasn’t a chunk of sundried tomato – I should have added one in. Definitely a savoury blend, though!', 'oh man i love this…except my brain thinks this is soup. not tea. thank you kittenna! really…this is super tasty delicious! It’s a savoury tea and though kittenna didn’t get much tomato, i for sure am. The black pepper adds a certain spiciness that i love. I can taste both the pepper and basil in this one. YUM! so glad i got to try this one out!', 'Wow – a huge thanks to LiberTEAS for instigating a swap with me!  Not only did she send me an amazing package, she was awesome enough to send me a sample of the <strong>famous</strong> blend!!! Thank you !The flavour is over the top. I only used 1.5 teaspoons and a pinch of seasoning salt, steeped for 3 minutes and I’m in love.Some reviews have mentioned that you have to be in the right mood for a tea like this. I think I would agree – but luckily for me, I was in the perfect mood! I had a suuuper sweet lunch and breakfast and was craving something salty and savoury. This seriously did the trick.The strongest flavour I’m getting is basil, with the sweetness of the sundried tomatoes and then finally the black pepper kick at the end. It’s subtle but definitely there.My favorite part about this tea is that it tastes like tea~! It’s blended perfectly, the black base with the hint of smokiness from the lapsang souchong (it really is the perfect amount) is so satisfying.Thank you LiberTEAs for letting me try this seriously one of a kind tea! I’m a fan. :)(Also, this tea will be the very first review to christen my blog! ee!)', 'Decided to play w/ this a bit and add 1/8tsp each dried oregano and garlic powder and have it w/ my lunch (Left over buffalo chicken pizza I added pineapple and corn to dipped in tetziki sauce w/ a pear and a salad w/ cucumber, carrot, cranberries, and shreadded coconut w/ Italian dressing.)Now this looks like tomato soup! While pale, it’s red and slightly opaque. Smells like tomato soup too!OHMYWOW! This is so good! The oregano and garlic really beat the lapsang into submition to the point where it’s pretty much hiding. It does make the tomatoes taste as if they’re fire roasted instead of stewed though. For a person who hates tomato juice and exceptionally watery pasta sauces, I’m shocked I love this so much. This cuppa absolutely gets a 100 in my book.A salsa flavored tea would be good! Tomato, black and red pepper, onion, cilantro, jalapeno, garlic… maybe a version w/ a bit of watermelon and mango (the type of salsa I like on my fish tacos).', 'One thing I love: tomatoes. One thing I don’t: most black teas. Here is how good this tea is: I got mine in the mail, made myself a cup, and was not even halfway through it before I got back on 52teas.com and ordered the very last package of the stuff. Each ingredient stands out – smoky, sun-dried tomatoes, the flat intrigue of basil, the spicy purr of black pepper. One of the most creative and marvelous-tasting cups of tea I’ve ever experienced. Bravo, Frank.', 'So grateful to have found this surprise squirrelled away while shuffling and attempting to order my cupboard. I like the savoury goodness of this tea a lot and would like to see it make a comeback one of these days. No sense of urgency, of course, as omg, too many teas. Nothing else to say as the name pretty well sums up what is going on here with the added slight smokiness in the base. Odd, but beautiful.', 'Here’s Hoping Teabox – Round Seven- Tea #1 A new round of the teabox to try means FUN. Signups for round eight are open — check it out! I had to give this one a try. PIZZA TEA!!!!! I was amazed with the first sip and it was probably the highlight of my day. I wasn’t that thrilled to try this with the tomato as that is my kryptonite, but with only one piece of tomato in the infuser, I thought it would be okay. PLUS, the basil, which I absolutely love should have balanced out the tomato. And it does. I’m accustomed to tulsi in a tea but that usually tastes very vegetal to me, like green beans. This is more true to actual basil so…. very delicious. The black tea is perfect here with the flavors. It’s so savory and I love tasting the basil more than the tomato which I might be ignoring. There is pepper to which really adds to the pizza flavor! This is good stuff. I love it. It’s unique. I wish 52Teas would try more savory teas, or at least use more of this delicious basil.

I’m really glad Anne decided to reblend this one, otherwise I’d have been forever wondering…I used 1 tsp of leaf for my cup, and gave it 2.5 minutes in boiling water as per the recommended parameters. Brewed, the scent is soup-like and a touch smoky. The taste is similar – there’s an initial note of tomato – sundried rather than fresh – that’s almost sweet in its intensity. The mid-sip is dominated mostly by the basil – which is really clear and well defined (yay!), and which cuts through some of the sweet tomato, adding an almost-vegetal, herby freshness. The pepper comes out at the end of the sip and lingers a little in the aftertaste, adding a touch of welcome spiciness. All in all, pretty perfect for a savoury tea! I can taste a hint of smoke, but it’s not overwhelming and it doesn’t drown out the other flavours – it was unexpected, at first, but it fades at the cup cools so there’s no fear if smoke isn’t your thing.As a first experience with a savoury tea, this was a good ‘un! Another I’d happily repurchase if it became available again in the future.

The steeped tea also had hints of tart fruit, caramel and cinnamon in its scent.The flavour top notes were a mix of barley, tart fruit and malt, with cocoa, cinnamon and caramel underneath. The taste captured all the notes of the scent.As it cooled, the caramel notes and malty chocolate notes intensified. A sweet spicy floral note also appeared.

My husband and I hosted a wedding shower for his sister yesterday, and every last minute leading up to it was spent cooking and decorating. I tried so many times to make a quick pot of tea but each time I was pulled away to do something else. Needless to say, I’ve really been missing my daily cuppa.I’m being lazy today so this is going right into a little glass teapot for a quick and easy, but sure to be extremely delicious, cup of tea. I read through some of the reviews here and saw that <strong>tea-sipper</strong> used about 1.5 teaspoons to make a nice-sized mug so I’m going to try that here.The dark leaves are small and spindly and smell like a good, solid black tea. I’m thinking this would probably be really good made either iced or hot. The brewed tea has a malty smell, very strong, and the tea leaves themselves have taken on a burnt aroma not unlike the charred bits of a toasty piece of artisan bread. It’s hard to describe, but the flavor here is different than most other black teas I’ve had. It’s simultaneously lighter on the tongue and stronger in flavor. I stand behind my previous comment – this would make the perfect iced tea.<strong>Second Steep</strong> <em>9 ounces water + 195 degrees + 5 minutes</em>This second cup seems to be even more flavorful. I’m tasting more of that black tea flavor I might normally experience – it seems more rounded and full.<strong>Third Steep</strong> <em>8 ounces water + 195 degrees + 6 minutes</em>I decided to take a break for some lunch (leftover party food!) but I had to come back to this for a third steep. This cup is much lighter in color and in flavor so I think I’ll stop here, but it’s still very enjoyable on the third cup.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Baked Bread, Burnt, Malt, Toasty\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Thanks so much for the samples, Nannuoshan! The leaves here are a dusty black medium length. Some Tan Yangs are golden, this one is completely black. They have a lovely biscuit fragrance. I steeped 1 1/2 teaspoons in my 12 ounce mug 3/4 full of water. The flavor is DIVINE. It hits all the right notes on this exhausting winter morning. This burgundy brew is a sweet chewy chocolate biscuit, if it’s served with some red wine. I’m not sure if that is a good pairing (I’m a tea person not a wine person), but it works so well here. There might be a tiny hint of cherry as well. I think the way I steeped it is perfect, no hint of astringency in the slightest. The mahogany steeped leaves are begging to be resteeped. This one is leaving me in tea heaven right now, and certainly making the few feet of snow out there and below zero temps just a little bit better. The second steep has a great aroma of fruit and maple syrup, which translates a little to the flavor, but this cup is completely different than the first, much lighter.

I quickly gulped down my first cup and made another. The second infusion smells strongly of freshly baked sourdough bread, chocolate, and honey. Not very much chocolate or cocoa in this infusion. It’s mostly fruit, honey, and grain with a slightly nutty aftertaste. It’s a tad lighter in body but the finish is still thick and syrupy. Caramel and pudding flavors dominate, coating my tongue.

This is the first of the three black tea samples I tried. Gabriele wrote in his note that it seems like I like black tea because I requested three, and he’s right! I do love black tea!This one sounded like a good one to try first. The dry leaf consists of about half-inch long, thin, twisty black leaves and smells like malt.

The steeped leaves smell like malt and cocoa. The liquor is reddish-brown in color and smells like cocoa and honey. It is medium viscosity, not overly thick or thin, and smooth and clear.The first infusion is smooth and tastes like cocoa, honey, and nuts. Yum! In the second infusion, the liquor is more red in color, like a cherry wood, and the flavors continue with cocoa, honey, and some malt creeping in. I found more even more honey notes in the third infusion, at least in the aroma, with light malt and cocoa.The recommended 3 infusions are perfect as the flavors start to diminish after that.Of the three black teas I tried, this one is my favorite. The cocoa and honey flavor lingered in my mind. I’m excited that I still have enough leaf for another session! Maybe I’ll wait to have it in the new gaiwan I ordered!', 'oh man. This was a sample from nanuoshan – thank you SO much for tyhe opportunity to try some of your teas! Honestly, i think if i hadn’t tried this along side one of his other offferings, i’d have been over the moon with this one. First off, the aroma of this one is amazing….i poured it and was like OMG is that the tea!!!  That being said, this doesn’t taste like the aroma haha. It’s stilla lovely tea but funnily enough, while the smell is like a sweet caramel, the taste is more like a creamy, fruity, slightly cocoa like tea. There’s no smokiness to be had in this one. I brewed this one gon fu – with probably the latter steeps being my favourite as the tea really started to have that heavier feel to it. Initial steeps were almost creamy in their lightness. Overall, this is a nice tea and i’m curious as to how it would lend itself to a western brew. I may just pick some up in the future to check it out!', 'Thank you Nannuoshan for this sample!After reading a brief description of the teas from a card Gabriele included in my samples box I thought this sounded like a nice late morning tea. The dry leaves are thin and wiry and smell like dry hay with a slight cocoa note underneath. The tea steeped to a much lighter color than I was expecting given the four minute steep time, but the results were lovely. There was a nice toasted grain flavor with hints of cocoa slipping in and out as I drank. As the tea cools there was more of a bready note at the front of the sip, which was nice in combination with the other flavors. Even with its lighter color I’d say this is a solid medium bodied tea, and I enjoyed having it in the late morning, but I also think it would be great as an afternoon tea.', 'Happy Sunday, my tea frens. First tea of the day comes from <strong>cookies</strong> and <strong>Nannuoshan</strong>. This looks different from the other Tanyang I’ve tried, from <strong>TeaVivre</strong>. That one was a more tippy tea, whereas these leaves are very thin and jet black in color. Dry scent is musty hay (I seem to be getting that a lot from black teas these days).The steeped tea smells sweet and thick with honey and bread notes. This is a yummy one. It’s malty and thick with flavor – it has that intensity that almost verges on bitterness but doesn’t quite get there. There are tasty honey notes (one of my favorite notes in tea) as well as dark wheat bread. I can also taste just a touch of savory which rounds it out nicely.

Those of you who know my review history know that Upton Tea’s “black dragon” is one of my “gotta have it on the shelf at all times” daily drinking teas. I rave about black dragon because it is a strong, powerful lapsang that doesn’t make you think of pork rinds or bacon or any other kind of meat product. It isn’t greasy or salty or sharp, or whatever it is that makes a lot of people think of cured meat when they smell it. But, at the end of the day, black dragon is still a very smokey tea.But this… this tea is a whole other universe.I opened the sample pack and thought … 4H fair. The smell of feed hay in a hot, close barn. Those pellets you can get from the candy vending machine to feed the animals at a petting zoo.The wet leaf? Oh man.The wet leaf is like drinking the zoo.

Drink this tea.Do you want to remember what it felt like to hug a sheep that hadn’t been shorn in a long, long time? Drink this tea.I don’t see this tea replacing anyone’s beloved lapsang or caravan tea. It’s too different. It doesn’t fill the same gap in the line-up, I don’t think.But it is a marvelously transcendent, nuanced, delightful tea. You must try it.

But I also bought a bit more than I normally might because the top note was described as chocolate. I thought, “Hey! A chocolate-y, smokey tea? I’m in!”I opened this tea up and it smelled delightfully smokey in that it was faint. Like you came across a camp that someone abandoned a few days earlier and there is still a faint whisp of wood smoke in the air. I brewed it up promptly.The smell of the liquid also carried that faint campfire scent. So far, so good. But when I took a sip, expecting to be hit with a smoked chocolate flavor, I was a bit let down. The smoke was there, though not overpowering, but the chocolate note was not to be found. There is a bit of cinnamon on the back end.

The sipdown of this tea came last night. I was a bit jittery due to an upcoming outing with my vocational rehabilitation clients and was having a lot of trouble getting settled for the evening. Naturally, I decided to add more caffeine to the fire. Even when I’m jittery, a nice gongfu session always seems to do the trick, and I end up out like a light when I should probably be bouncing off the walls and/or babbling incoherently in a corner somewhere. It took me awhile, but I finally fell asleep and woke up as ready to face the day as could possibly be expected given the circumstances.My rambling should have made it obvious that I prepared this tea gongfu style. I followed Verdant’s guidelines for this one. After a very quick rinse, I steeped 5 grams of loose tea leaves in 4 ounces of 205 F water for 4 seconds. I followed this initial infusion with 10 additional infusions. Steep times for these infusions were as follows: 7 seconds, 10 seconds, 13 seconds, 16 seconds, 19 seconds, 22 seconds, 25 seconds, 28 seconds, 31 seconds, and 34 seconds. I probably could have gotten at least one or two more infusions out of this, but stopped where I did because it was late and I needed to get some sleep.Prior to the rinse, the dry leaves gave off a mild smoky scent with hints of spice and chocolate. After the rinse, I noted strong aromas of chocolate, cinnamon, pine needles, and smoke. The first infusion produced a similarly intense nose. In the mouth, there were distinct impressions of chocolate, cinnamon, pine, smoke, and sage. There was also a slight sweetness left on the back of the throat. Subsequent infusions were similarly spicy, smoky, and savory, though they were also incredibly balanced. I noted the emergence of toast, honey, elderberry, and malt notes underneath the dominant flavors of sage, pine, smoke, and chocolate. Boy, Verdant’s taste profile was more or less dead on with this one. The later infusions were mild and smooth, though traces of chocolate, pine, toast, smoke, and cinnamon were still evident. There was also the expected Wuyi minerality that became more pronounced on these final infusions.I’ve had nearly a full day to process my thoughts on this tea, and to be honest, I am glad I did not try to post this review last night. Immediately after finishing the session, I was a bit disappointed that this lapsang was not smokier. I was also a little disappointed that the flavors faded a little sooner than I would have preferred (I was kind of nitpicking though-I did manage to get eleven infusions out of 5 grams of this tea, and at least 7-8 of them were very good). In retrospect, however, this was a very sophisticated, balanced lapsang souchong that did not resort to over-the-top and/or artificial smokiness.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Chocolate, Fruity, Honey, Malt, Mineral, Pine, Sage, Smoke, Toast\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'I keep forgetting I have this one.

I also have more than five minutes to make and drink some tea. Life is good. And, this is the perfect time to take Earl Grey Classic by Fortnum &amp; Mason for a test drive.When I pried open the lid of the tin, one of the freshest and most natural bergamot aromas that I had ever experienced hit my nose. I hoped that the taste would match this great smell.Fortnum &amp; Mason doesn’t include detailed brewing instructions on their packaging. After researching the procedures of other fellow Steepsters for this tea, I chose 205 degrees for three minutes as my method of madness.The brewed liquor also had a fresh bergamot scent, although a little lighter than I expected. The color was golden brown.The taste was black tea, balanced with bergamot flavor. The freshness of the bergamot scent did carry over into the taste, but the bergamot did not control the total flavor of the tea. Instead, it was a smooth, malty, and full black tea flavor with bergamot blended into the taste. There was no bitterness. The aftertaste was lightly shadowed with bergamot accents.This is a fine and smooth Earl Grey tea. I would rate the bergamot power 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 10.One thing that sets this tea apart and above some of the other Earl Grey teas I’ve tasted is the freshness of the bergamot flavor. It’s not as strong as the Rishi Earl Grey (still my favorite Earl Grey), which I would give a 10 on the bergamot power scale. But, this is a very nice tea that I would enjoy in the mornings or afternoons.', 'Tea of the morning…..I have been eyeing this tea for a long time. While overseas ordering from Fortnum was a complete bust, I was able to purchase this one in person at Williams-Sonoma. I guess my curiosity won out over my feelings about the poor experience of ordering directly from them. I am very much willing to try any Earl as long as it is easy to obtain. I just happened to be at the mall this past weekend, so it was not even a special trip. I also picked up some sachets of Harney Organic English Breakfast for travel. I only travel with bagged tea anymore as the rest of the gear is kind of cumbersome. Yes, I have gone soft. Gone are the days of hardcore brewing no matter where I am. Convenience wins out most of the time.The main reason why this tea intrigued me so was that it was a China black base. In reading the package it calls the base a “predominantly China blend”. I was kind of surprised at the leaf size. It seems pretty smallish like a BOP or even smaller. They are very dark and the smell of bergamot is bright and citrusy. The first pot I made had quite a bit of dust (now wet) in the bottom of my cup, meaning that it made it out of the infuser and then escaped the teapot. I guess I am not super pleased about the leaf quality for the price I paid. In the US it is about $16 for 125g. Lupicia is a much better value, but the shipping kills it for me since their Earl Grey is pretty much the only tea I would rebuy from there right now.As for taste, it is very good. The tea base does make a rich cup of tea. The bergamot reads a little less bright than Lupicia, but not as musty (sorry about that descriptor, but I can’t think of a better way to describe it) as some Earls. I do like the packaging. Not sure if it would make the rebuy list, yet, but I am glad I finally got around to trying it. It is a good, solid cup of tea. (Rating started at 87)Usual teapot method.Edit to add: All of the dust in the bottom of my cup makes it pretty bitter by the end of the pot. I will drink this, but not replace it. Glad I tried it, though. (Rating took a serious hit by the end of the pot. Since the tea I brewed was measured from the top of the tin, I am pretty sure this is as good as it gets. Dust will be worse by the bottom of the tin.)', 'I’m not a huge fan or Earl Greys, but Tony is, so I like to surprise him with various Earls as they come my way.

I don’t feel that the flavor is lacking in any way.It is great on ice as well, using the method I described in my previous post about Taylor’s of Harrogate’s <em>Ntingwe Kwazulu</em>.Shipping took quite a long time, but they included an extra tea for me, so it’s all good!

We have a few little side trips to make, but mostly we will be home for the next few weeks. Bliss! This is my celebratory cuppa, and I just realized that I still have a whole tin of it left. More to celebrate! Also, winter looks like it has officially arrived at our house. I think we got round 9 inches of snow yesterday. Bring it, Old Man Winter! I have my tea to keep me warm!This is my tea first love. It has been so long since I have had a cup of this, I was worried that it would not appeal as much. Some of the teas I thought I really liked over the past few years are pretty much in the ‘meh’ category as of now. This one, however, has stood the test of time. I love it just as much today as I ever have. It is my tea perfection by which all other black teas seem to be compared. I do reserve this one for special days, and I definitely think that might be contributing to my feelings about it. Whatever it is, I am going with it! Notes of cocoa, malt, slight smoke, and just…..magic.Usual teapot method. I do measure the perfect teaspoons on the scant side for this one.', 'Treating myself to this magical tea today. The touch of smoke. The chocolate notes. The richness. The inexplicably fruity note on the end of the sip. This is a wonderful, wonderful miracle of nature that always stops me in my tracks whenever I brew a cup. I love all of my teas, but this one I treasure.', 'Well, this is different….I wanted iced tea and I wanted it right away, and it had to be sweet tea because I was trying to create a real Southern meal such as would be served after a funeral.Food is of utmost importance at Southern funerals. Now, there wasn’t a funeral but there was a burial as I finally got around to burying my eldest brother who was old enough to be my dad and who died in 1984. My daughters and I had to find his box and dig it up when my mother’s property was sold after her death, which wasn’t easy because Dad never told us EXACTLY where he had buried the ashes. I wasn’t even sure they were in a box, but thankfully, they were. (Are you horrified? Or amused? Bet you’re wishing you coulda been there!)SO – I promised the kids real fried chicken and fixins’ because I don’t fry ANYTHING EVER but that is what you eat after a burial. By the time we got home from the cemetary and buying the food we were so hungry! I couldn’t wait long enough to brew a pot of tea, but I had a pot of Keemun Mao Feng left over from yesterday. I heated it a bit in the microwave, added a little sugar and poured it over ice! Ta-dah! The best iced tea I have ever had, I think. It had a lovely rich edge that grocery store bags just don’t give you – a little something extra in the flavor profile. Bravo, Keemun Mao Feng! Rest in peace, big brother. I hope he heard us playing the 50’s and 60’s stations on satellite radio in his honor today!', 'I am trying this today – my experience with Keemuns has been a bit “meh” but I’ve read so many good things about this one.I swear the dry leaves smelled like a Merlot wine and are very slender and beautiful looking. I tried to not overdo it with the leaf here. I eyeballed it but measured out about 1 tsp for my 10 oz mug.Success! I liked this one. The results are quite delightful!The tea liquor is a medium reddish brown and has a lovely cocoa fragrance. I’m picking up some hints of malt and the aftertaste is surprisingly floral, almost like a second flush darjeeling (but sweeter). I am not getting much smokiness, perhaps just a touch . But it may be my tastebuds are burnt out from that Russian caravan I had a little while ago.I might even be braver and go for a slightly longer steep next time, but it ended up being very nice the way I prepared it. No need for sugar or soymilk at all, this is a great one to sip on plain. Smooth and without much astringency. I’m glad I but the bullet and went for it! So good!', 'A while ago I would read tasting notes for unflavored black teas with descriptions of notes of chocolate and such, and I would wonder what on earth these people were tasting because I never tasted that when I tried black teas. I’m pretty sure I tried this tea at the Harney Soho store ages ago after reading notes on here about it, and I didn’t really get it. Now I’ve gotten into Tan Yangs and other Fujian blacks, and lately I’ve come across a lot of tasting notes about Tan Yangs talking about how a particular tea is like a Keemun minus the smoke. Thanks to <strong>SimplyJenW</strong>, I get to try this Keemun again now and make the comparisons!Honestly, the descriptions of smoky notes in Keemuns have me figuring I won’t like them as much because I’m not a big fan of smoke in my teas. And the steeped tea certainly smells smoky! It reminds me a tad of the wood-fired tieguanyin I had once in levels of smokiness… not like a campfire, but something roasted on one, perhaps. I do also smell more Tan Yang-like chocolate and molasses notes underneath it. The flavor delivers on the scent, and I can definitely see the resemblance to a Tan Yang. I first taste very delicious chocolatey and molasses-y notes, and then the light smokiness grows in the latter part of the sip. Definite sweetness present here.This is partly rated on the fact that I can objectively tell that this is a very good tea and I can appreciate it as such. But it also falls into the range of teas that I wouldn’t seek out again… I’m just not a fan of smoky notes in my teas. But I’m really thankful to get to try this tea to further my tea education and also narrow my black tea searching!', 'Enjoying some of the remains of this sample which was generously supplied by SimplyJenW many moons ago. I remember really liking it and hoarding the remains for some sort of good tea apocalypse. Steeped, the liquor is a light orange, I’m surprised at how light it is, actualy. The aroma is very bold with a strong cocoa note and a sense of bitterness, but that could be the cocoa I’m picking up on.First sips yield a bold rich cocoa that quickly morphs into a sweet note with a hint of spice in there. Cinnamon is my first thought, as it so frequently is. It’s like I am drinking three distinct things but they are coming through in that order. This is even more remarkable than my memory of it led me to believe. I am getting absolutely no bitterness and not any discernible astringency, just cocoa, something sweet and something cinnamon. Fantastic!I just looked this up on the Harney site and though it is definitely a delicious tea I was surprised at the price. $20 for 2 oz is about $20 for 50 grams – it is definitely good, but that price is unbelievable. For $10/ounce I would probably rather pick up some Verdant Tea but I am really glad to have this sample still. Thanks again SimplyJen!', 'First thing tea this morning, good pick. Light smoke, chocolate, nice Goldilocks body. This one’s also maltier at the front than others I’ve tried. And there’s that fruity wine scent to the spent leaves the other Harney Keemuns have. That said, I’m beginning to suspect that Keemuns are, much like each year’s overwhelming number of Darjeelings, winding up to be a tea where I don’t pay terribly much attention on the fine distinctions between vendors/crops etc.—where so long as they fit the general mold of what I expect, I’ll just reach for any decent one when that’s what I’m seeking. This hasn’t been true at all for whatever reason with other teas, especially Chinese, Taiwanese, and Japanese—I get very brand loyal and even season/year loyal at times it seems—but maybe that’s because Keemun, while Chinese, is heavier and more opaque a thing, similar to Assam or other Indian tea. Hm. IIRC I liked Little Red Teacup’s Keemun and it felt markedly distinct. But really, so long as it’s got some chocolate and smoke and is a good balance of smooth and full/strong, I’m good.That said, if any of you seasoned experts have one you are just flipping nuts over I haven’t tried (mine have mainly come from Harney, Teavivre, Little Red Teacup, Verdant, and Tao Tea Leaf) and can procure easily enough from the US, I’m all ears as always.

This was the unflavored black tea in the 3 tea flight. I gave it a try and my taste buds did a bit of a dance. It is a very sweet tea. I felt like I was drinking Honey.  I was going to leave the store without buying it, got near the door and realized that I desperately wanted another taste of it, so I walked out with a 2oz bag. This is a great addition to my cabinet.', 'This was a truly special treat for me this morning, especially because until yesterday afternoon I didn’t even know I would possess it! Many thanks to <strong>SimplyJenW</strong> for a lovely surprise packet of tea to sample. :) I couldn’t choose, so I turned the packets face down, shuffled them and chose one at random. This is the lucky winner today. Well, actually I am because this tea is really wonderful.First, when I sniffed the tea in the packet, I picked up on a very roasted scent, much like a roasted Dong Ding. So, in my mind, I imagined I’d be tasting something similar. The taste, however, is not anything like that, other than that there is a definite smoky note to the tea. What I do taste is something unique. There’s a hint of cocoa, kind of like hot chocolate before the milk is added, but it has a sweetness and a nuttiness to it that keep the taste on the lighter side instead of being bitter. It’s unlike any tea I’ve tasted before.Thank you again, <strong>SimplyJenW</strong>, for a lovely tea this morning. I can’t wait to try the next ones. :)', 'This is a very high quality tea. The dried leaves are extremely dark, but lighten up quite a bit after steeping, producing a dark cognac liquor. The aroma is what really made me decide to purchase this. I knew that I was looking for a typical Keemun-esque brew, one that was extremely fragrant and fruity. I am by no means dissatisfied. In taking a whiff, I pick up notes of stone fruits, possibly apricots and plums, as well as that of rich cocoa (as was also described by Harney &amp; Sons). The flavor is quite similar. Although I am not a big fan of chocolatey-tasting teas, I must say that as a finishing piece on your palate, it is not overwhelming, but rather a major compliment to the rest of the drink.

Anyway, this tea is yet another strong offering from the He family. So far, the 2016 harvests have yielded some strong teas.I prepared this tea gongfu style. After a quick rinse (2-3 seconds), I steeped 5 grams of loose tea leaves in 4 ounces of 205 F water for 8 seconds. I followed this up with 10 additional infusions. Steep times for these infusions were as follows: 12 seconds, 15 seconds, 19 seconds, 22 seconds, 26 seconds, 29 seconds, 33 seconds, 36 seconds, 40 seconds, and 50 seconds.Prior to the rinse, the dry leaves gave off a dusty aroma that momentarily obscured rich scents of malt, dark chocolate, roasted grain, and black cherry. After the rinse, the malt, cherry, chocolate, and roasted grain aromas became much more focused. The first infusion yielded a similar, yet even richer aroma. In the mouth, I picked up robust notes of roasted grain, dark chocolate, black cherry, malt, orange, and honey underscored by a hint of caramel. The following 5 infusions produced a tea that was more mellow in both aroma and taste. The caramel notes became more pronounced, providing a nice balance to the touches of black cherry, dark chocolate, roasted grain, malt, orange, and honey. I also noticed a slight creaminess chased by very light minerality on the finish. The final series of infusions presented delicate aromas and flavors of malt, roasted grain, cream, honey, black cherry, and dark chocolate. The orange notes became increasingly floral and fragile. The minerality was also amped up somewhat, though not significantly.\\nMore often than not, I am very impressed by Verdant Tea’s Laoshan offerings. Although there are a few l like less than the others, for the most part, this is a very consistent and rewarding collection of teas. This tea is yet another strong addition to the portfolio.

I’ve been getting a bit weary of black tea lately since I’ve ended up with a surprising number of different kinds in samples, but my water was already boiling when it came time to pick out a tea and I’ve been wanting to work on crackling my new ruyao ware, so black tea it was. 3-5 grams to a 100 ml gaiwan, preheated, boiling water, 25 seconds to start.It’s as if this tea heard my misgivings and gently placated my concerns this grey morning by delivering a much more subdued, but still intensely rich and comforting chocolate flavor with only tones of the black tea maltiness I was starting to grow a bit bored of. Surprisingly sweet for any tea I’ve had, it has a honey sweetness to it that I find hard to believe is a natural byproduct of just tea leaves. This sweet lingers strongly in the back of your throat after each sip, it is definitely the sweetest tea I’ve had to date. The lighter orange amber color seems to reflect the tea’s lighter flavor as well, although the first steep or two does have a predominately intense chocolate flavor I also enjoyed. Overall, I would place this as a much lighter but no less comforting alternative to hot chocolate anytime, I may have to stock up on this tea.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Cacao, Dark Chocolate, Honey, Malt, Sweet\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'My absolute favorite tea.

My internet provider’s building caught on fire. (Actually, it caught on fire <em>twice</em>, according to my grandmother. I don’t follow the news as closely.) Luckily, it doesn’t sound as though anyone was hurt, but it has caused absolute chaos in the city, as that building was a big communications hub.Home internet services have mostly been down, of course, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Radio stations were taken out, cable TV went down, city hall’s phones weren’t working, multiple online bank services were down, Alberta Health Services’ network went down… Think that’s getting bad? Oh no: <strong>911 SERVICES</strong> also went down in the core of the city. Emergency services were frantically trying to get the message out to people that calling 911 on a landline would reach no one, and to use a cell phone if possible. THAT BAD.Thankfully, I understand that things are mostly back to normal now, and the whole incident has generated serious discussion about our city’s electronic infrastructure. As for me, I’ve been able to get on Steepster little bits for the past few days, but my dash would not load well until now. So this review is backlogged from, like, last Thursday. (Yes, embarrassing late, circumstance of “free” considered.) Don’t worry though, I have a few pages of notes on the tea tasting in my tea notebook to draw from, so it should be fairly accurate.And kind of an exciting 50th note, eh? <strong>Apologies in advance for the length.</strong> Hope you have a scroll wheel on your mouse, but I have a lot to say this time. (Steepster really needs a “Read More” function.)So I went to pick up that package from the post office, and it was indeed my package from Peony Tea S. (Yes, that’s Peony Tea-space-capital-S. My brain keeps trying to read it as “Peony Teassss” with a long, drawn-out S.) Initially I was slightly miffed about it not just getting dropped at the door, but I suppose it’s nice to have the extra security measure of signing for it rather than potentially have it disappear and wonder forever where the tea went. And the post office it was left at is a pleasant stroll away.When I emailed my mailing address for this promo, I added a note that I’m less fond of pu-erh and green tea thus far. (I completely spaced on the asthma issue, but thankfully didn’t end up getting sent a lapsang souchong. Would have served me right if I had!)So I got sent these three: -<a href=\"https://www.peonyts.com/shop/index.php/product-categories/jade-oolong.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.peonyts.com/shop/index.php/product-categories/jade-oolong.html</a> -<a href=\"https://www.peonyts.com/shop/index.php/product-categories/phoenix-dancong-heavenly-fragrance.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.peonyts.com/shop/index.php/product-categories/phoenix-dancong-heavenly-fragrance.html</a> -And this one, <a href=\"https://www.peonyts.com/shop/index.php/product-categories/yunnan-black.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.peonyts.com/shop/index.php/product-categories/yunnan-black.html</a>Also, it came with a measuring “spatula” which is free with all first-time orders: <a href=\"https://www.peonyts.com/packaging-measurement/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.peonyts.com/packaging-measurement/</a>Which, if I’m honest about it, I was almost more excited for (in advance of their arrival) than the tea itself. The website may say, “It may not be the most gorgeous or exquisite instrument around,” but I say that it’s a far cry from the metal teaspoons I’ve been using, and I think it’s pretty. Not sure what it’s made of, though. I’ve actually been finding it extremely useful for large-leaved teas that I already own and previously found hard to scoop even with a pot-bellied spoon. DAVIDs Nepal Black, for instance.So now that it’s here, review! Including a review of the overall package I got. I decided to start with the Yunnan Black, as that’s basically a safe starting point for me based on past experience.<strong>Delivery Time:</strong> Peony Tea S. wants to know how long it takes to deliver to Canada, and I think Calgary, Alberta is a pretty good test because my area is notorious for slow and misplaced mail and packages. I received an email saying that my package had been sent out on July 1st. The post tried to deliver the package first on the 9th. That is, in my experience, <em>exceptional</em> delivery time under any circumstances. I’m even more impressed given how far it had to go. At the risk of sounding like a complete boob, I had literally no idea Peony Tea S. was based in Singapore – not having heard of them yet, I vaguely presumed they are based in America, and didn’t realize otherwise until I picked up my package stamped “SINGAPORE” in four places. Well, this tea arrived faster than any from America, so…<em>nice</em>, and whatever postal service they’re using at their end they should keep using.(I should also note here that I was provided with a tracking number for the package. I originally intended to check up on it; but as I have never used a tracking number, I completely forgot. I looked up the number after the delivery guy came Monday though, and all it said was that the package was dispatched to Canada. Presumably it now says that the package has arrived, although I can’t get it to load. Kiiinda already knew that, so I’m not convinced the tracking number is worthwhile.)<strong>Packaging:</strong> The teas and spatula arrived in a flattish cardboard box and wrapped in bubble wrap. Not that I don’t bash my own tea around an embarrassing amount of the time, but it’s nice to see the tea protected before it gets to me.The teas are in opaque, white bags similar to the bags you get at DAVIDsTEA for those familiar with the latter company. They are a comfortable size for the tea, which is not squished. On one side is a pretty blue-and-white logo/label with artwork featuring peonies; on the other side of the bag is a label with tea info and brewing instructions. On the Yunnan Black, the label looks like this:<strong>Origin:</strong> Fengqing, Yunnan, China <strong>Harvest Season:</strong> (left blank) <strong>Shelf Life:</strong> (left blank) <strong>Best Before:</strong> (left blank) <strong>Quantity:</strong> (left blank) <strong>Recommended Brewing Instructions:</strong> 1. <strong>Water Temperature:</strong> 95 C/203 F 2. <strong>Quantity:</strong> 3g/1 spatula per 100mL 3. <strong>Infusion Time:</strong> 1.5 mins. 4. <strong>No of Steeps:</strong> 3 times…After scratching my head over the blank spaces for a bit, I came to the conclusion that what is already on the label must be pre-printed and the rest (which would naturally change more often) are printed later. But for the purposes of this promo, Peony Tea S. didn’t bother(?). I would obviously have to actually order more tea to find out. I think it’s cool to have a label with space for all that information, as I have had to repeatedly ask some vendors even to get information like the origin.Now, I must note the brewing instructions. One-and-a-half minutes seems a bit short for a black, doesn’t it? Only 100mL of water seems a little low, doesn’t it? A whole spatula/3g (since everyone who orders with them presumably gets sent a spatula the first time, there is a standardization there to work with) seems like a lot of leaf for that amount of water, yes?I puzzled over this for a minute until it clicked that these <em>have</em> to be gong fu brewing instructions; that’s the working presumption here. So I went to go find my gaiwan. (Which is luckily exactly 100mL.) But if you typically brew Western, these brewing instructions are going to seem a little crazy. Have no fear, you can brew this one Western as well if you really want, using common steeping parameters for blacks.<strong>A Note:</strong> Before I get to the actual tasting, I would like to point something out. In the past, before tasting a tea – and certainly before writing a review of one – I am horribly, horribly guilty of <em>always</em> reading other reviews first to see what others thought of it. Sometimes this is useful, but I have an ugly feeling that it is not always a good thing. Maybe even <em>usually</em> not a good thing. What it means is that you have certain taste expectations before you even put the tea in your mouth, which I’d argue can alter how you perceive the tea to actually taste.In this case, I was not able to get online to check reviews for this tea before I drank it. So I was making hard-copy notes and I essentially wrote this review completely “blind.” Which had…interesting consequences that I will get to later.Also, while perusing Chapters a few weeks ago, I found this cool-looking book on tea. I could sadly not afford to buy it, but I did flip through it, and read some bits about tea tasting. When tasting tea, the book recommended that you:1. First, exhale <em>completely</em>. 2. Take a sip of tea. 3. Hold the tea in your mouth across your entire tongue and inhale deeply through your nose. 4. Swallow.It <em>really</em> seems to make a difference in the taste, and I tried to do that as much as possible through this review.<strong>The Tea:</strong> <em>Dry Smell:</em> Not at all subtle. When I opened the bag, this tea’s smell was a real smack to the face. And it smacked of chocolate. Rich, dark chocolate. Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, whoa chocolate. And something unidentifiably fruity underneath.(“Unidentifiably fruity” is an ongoing problem for me. I should note here that not only am I still a real novice to tea drinking, I am also not a foodie of any description. My diet largely consists of mac ‘n’ cheese and tacos. Learning to identify various notes in tea is an ongoing process, and often something like, “fruit, but I don’t know what kind,” is the best I can manage.)<em>Wet Smell:</em> More fruity than before. Also, there is a distinctly “tea,” smell about it, but I note that it is a different “tea” smell from the Assam I often have for breakfast. Lighter, of course, but different in other ways I cannot currently articulate. Maybe this is a distinctly Yunnan “tea” smell? I will need to compare more straight blacks in the future.<em>1st Infusion:</em> (I assumed that the time on the label was for the first infusion, so this is 1.5 minutes.) Dark, midnight dark, with deep dark chocolate notes. I’m actually blown away at how chocolate it is without actually being flavoured. This is tough to explain – it is not like a chocolate-flavoured tea in the sense that you put it in your mouth and immediate identify “chocolate!” Rather, it is more like a really strong <em>impression</em> of chocolate which is completely natural to the tea. I think the thing which is <em>most</em> making me think of chocolate is the almost-bitterness to it which good quality dark chocolate has without shading into actual, unpleasant bitterness. There’s something sweeter and lighter riding on top of the cup as it cools that makes me think of caramel. And even though I tasted no berries in this infusion, I noticed that the bottom of the cup seriously smelled like – or reminded me of – the raspberry-flavoured dark chocolate a now-ex gave me once.<em>2nd Infusion:</em> (2 min.) Not nearly as chocolate, but even deeper and darker than the first. Seriously. I described the first infusion as “midnight dark” in my notes, and it was lighter than this. That doesn’t mean that this is a “strong” tea like a Kenyan black. Just dark! There’s a slight astringency that I picked up, but nothing to the point that I would mentally knock a tea down from “good” to merely “interesting” to drink. (Not a fan of astringency, me.) I didn’t notice at all if the first infusion had any astringency to it, so I guess it must not be terribly noticeable if it is. There’s something fruity riding on top which, again, comes out as it cools – this is one of those teas that will always get more complex as the cup’s temperature drops. I can still taste the caramel-like note I found before, but it’s faded well into the background.<em>3rd infusion:</em> (2.5 min.) The brief astringency is gone – this is a very smooth cup – and here’s the fruit at last! The chocolate is virtually gone, coming out occasionally and unexpectedly at the back of a few sips. The impression of something dark and juicy – like maybe a dark berry, not sure – is strong. If the previous infusions were dark, this is like sunlight shining through the top of the forest. This is not an “earthy” tea, this is a “leafy” tea. Which may seem like a stupid thing to say about a beverage which is made by putting leaves in hot water… But the taste associations are bringing me back to hiking up mountains in Banff with my dad as a kid. This tea tastes like those times when you were about two-thirds of the way through the forest, and you could sense the approach of the moment when you would break through the tree line into blazing sun and chilly air. There’s a natural sweetness here that comes out more – say it with me now – as the cup cools.<em>4th infusion:</em> (3 min.) Yes, I know the label said three infusions, but I’m a <em>rebel!</em>…Except that no, no, you really shouldn’t infuse this more than three times. I can faintly taste chocolate again, but I swear I can also taste my kettle. (Is that what my kettle tastes like? <em>Ew.</em>) It’s still drinkable, but there’s nothing interesting going on. This tea goes hard, and stops suddenly.<em>Western style:</em> Okay, by the time I got to this I was terribly reviewed-out, but I never consider a tea completely reviewed until I’ve had it Western style. This is maybe hypocritical, as I don’t consider tea un-reviewed if I haven’t had it gong fu style, but Western is what I’m used to. So after brewing it the way I was suggested to by the vendor, I still need to test it in the way I find most comfortable to drink. I don’t necessarily hold it against a tea for not having the flexibility to be drunk Western style, but it will add additional points to my rating. In this case, 1 spatula of tea per 250mL brewed for 4 minutes turned out a charming blend of the gong fu infusions, with strong fruity notes that blended well with sweetener.So, the rating: my first feeling was that this was somewhere in the 80s, but I bumped it up a few points for being entirely pleasant to drink clear (I’m the sugarhound, after all) and a few more for the pleasant Western cup. So that put me at 90. And I hope I have convinced you that this tea is worth a 90 on its own merits and not because I got it for free. (Also, the packaging and delivery time, while I mentioned them, did not factor into the rating. Had they been bad, I still would only be rating the tea itself.)So. One last thing. I mentioned earlier that I wrote this review blind. Well, once I got internet access back enough to look up this tea on the website…here is the description:“Yunnan Black or Dian Hong is one of the most beloved of China’s black teas. It’s rich aroma, full flavor and natural citrusy taste makes it an excellent choice of lovers of black tea.[…Taste:Sweet, citrusy with hints of red dates.\"<strong>Citrus?!</strong> Citrus. <em>Citrus?</em> The hell. Where did I get chocolate from, then?I could, of course, go back, try another cup and then declare, “Well, I’ll be! It <em>does</em> taste like citrus! Now I look like less of a boob. I can taste it after all; must have been sick that first time.”Thing is, I spent a good hour or so concentrating on the taste of this tea, and didn’t come up with “citrus” even once…so that wouldn’t be honest, would it?Oh well. This is a really good tea, and I am happy (based on my experience thus far) to recommend Peony Tea S. I’m sure that any lover of blacks will enjoy this one.Even if it doesn’t taste a <em>thing</em> like chocolate to you.', 'The aroma of the dry leaf is sweet. I agree with <strong>TeaEqualsBliss</strong> – I smell the sweetness of dates here. Even the brewed tea has a hint of the date-like fragrance, and this translates to the flavor. Sweet, with hints of earth and leather, fruit undertones, and even hints of chocolate.An really delightful Dian Hong. This is one I could drink every day.', 'Short review : this is wonderful. Really really wonderful.Long version and all about me: I can´t quite believe I had this waiting for months till i tried it. But did. I am really a bad-weather tea lover. When it gets really really hot, it seems like I only really cold water will do for me. People have tried to educate me better about how refreshing tea can be when it´s hot. But it just does not work for me.So all this to say that when PeonyTS very kindly offered some teas to test mail services, I did jump at the opportunity (testing receiving tea! I can do that!) but the poor teas languished waiting for a couple months (no fear, sealed, and the white and green are in the fridge). But finally the weather has turned autumnal enough, I really missed brewing carefully a cup and having it.The tea itself is just wonderful. Seller describes it has having a hint of dates, which is not exactly what came to my mind. But it´s a wonderfully rich, complex taste. And so smooth, such a generous tea. I really loved it. I think I might have skimped on tea for the water I used and might have gone past the 90 seconds because i got distrated, but it still produced something sublime. I am now very curious about what the next steeps will produce.Ah, about the details, the packaging is foil hermetically sealed ziploc, packaged just right in order to not crush. The tea itself looks wonderful, long long leaves. A really great tea.', 'Free sample from Peony T SFirst off I would like to thank Peony for including me in their shipping experiment. I received three very generous packets of tea in a very short time from them. I hope the experiment was worth it for Peony, because it certainly was for me.So, I drank this last night and am only now getting around to writing it up. The dry leaf is a beautiful golden colour. Sticking my nose in the packet I get a whiff of hay. It’s that lovely smell of fresh hay that you get when stacking it in the barn. I think there is a bit of molasses in there too, so maybe it smells like the feed room when mixing up the horse feed more than the barn. Yes, that’s about right. I love that.Drinking it, I am struck by its resemblance to Teavivre’s Fengqing Dragon Pearls. That’s probably not a surprise because the packet tells me, now that I look at it, that the tea is from Fengqing. The tea is malty, sweet and mellow.

I love to do cakes sans icing with coconut cream, you brush it onto the dry cake over and over until it’s just oozing with creamy coconut goodness. Mmm!This is a very chocolatey tea! And not fake chocolate, but nice dark roasty cocoa notes. The coconut kind of plays second fiddle to the chocolate but it’s still there!

The odds of it having been contaminated and ending up tasting like that are quite slim, so I have to assume that it’s an intentional note in the tea… Yeah, this is just weird. The aftertaste is honey-like and nice, but the initial flavour is verging on unpleasant.I will admit that I did not rinse; I will try to remember to do that next time I give this a shot.

I can’t help myself. I have beloved tea’s that must be shared with people that love tea too.  Many times when you go into a tea shop the people working there are transient. Students, or casual part time workers who may know something about tea but have not made tea their passion or career. This is not the case with my tea pub. (These people know their stuff!)I received this tea on one recent visit as a gift. (There had been exited tastings behind the bar of my Laoshan White and the Bailin Gonfu Black that day).Today: I used a Gaiwan (4oz) with boiling water and steeped 2min.Wet leaf, copper and olive…very pretty…changing to dark olive green by the 3rd steeping with the leaves open and large. The liquor was honey red gold gradually getting lighter by the 3rd steep.I was just about to go into the 3 tasting phases of this tea when I couldn’t. The tea is not about a sterile set of numbers and discriptions. So here goes ad lib…When I look at the whole tasting experience I’m reminded of Fall.  There is an introduction immediately to a sweet malty rye bread with peach jam. Then banana peel, not a bitter taste at all…but a taste and texture that is thick and fuzzy. Fall, bread baking and holidays.I could picture my daughter, three grandaughters and I in her big (huge) farm kitchen preparing our Thanksgiving Feast. She would grind wheat and make the bread for the family. Someone else would make pies (Used to be me). Homemade cranberry sauce bubbleing on the stove, Turkey already in the roaster. I’m commanded to make the beloved candied yams layered with apples and pecans.  The second steep had my yam and apple flavor (without nuts and butter), just a more squashy yam and the sugary golden delicious apples cooked together so that the flavor melts in your mouth. Fragrant and luscious. Oh the taste is so good and rich. Dripping. I’ve never tasted a tea like it!The breadiness of the first steeping was gone along with the malt. The banana too.The final steeping was like the end of a meal when you’re full and scraping the bottom of the bowl. Not much was left. It was still good to drink but lighter and squashier. This was a shadow of that amazing second steeping.What a generous gift. One of the finest, fruitiest Black Tea’s I’ve tasted. A Taiwanese Tea and Assam blend grown close to Sun Moon Lake.', '1 second rinse with tea infusing temperature water 1 tablespoon for 375 mlNice smooth flavour. Molasses-like sweetness. Leathery hints in the background. Lingering sweetness, reminds me of a ginseng-type sweetness.Second infusion at 2.5 minutes with near-boiling water.Third infusion at 3.5 minutes with near-boiling water.

I really appreciated this tea. Even if I’m not a big plain tea drinker, I manage to recognize an high quality tea and it is really one. It’s not an heavy malty black tea but a medium bodied one with wonderful notes of wood (that’s what I felt !) There is absolutely no bitterness with this tea. I love it.', 'I placed an order with Red Blossom and am so far enjoying their teas! I really like their tins too. Super cute. This tea actually surprised me a bit. I was expecting it to be fruity and not too deep or full, but it was all of the above! It’s a pretty decent morning cup. Happy to have more of this!', '1/26/14 Tasted at a tea event. A very interesting tea, both in terms of tasting and in history. It is made from a tea plant which is a hybrid of the native Taiwanese C. sinenses v. sinensis and the Indian C. sinensis v. assamica , which was imported to the island early last century to help establish a black tea industry. It was a very nice tea to drink, full of the malty peppery chocolaty notes that Assam teas have, all wrapped up with a vegetal bell peppery kind of greenness that was quite interesting. Unlike the previous more traditional Chinese teas, this black tea didn’t come through the second serving as strongly, and our host told us that is is pretty normal. Apparently the highly oxidized black teas infuse much more readily and thus don’t support multiple infusions as well.', 'My first tea of the day comes from <strong>Blodeuyn’s</strong> epic black tea sample swap. Another Taiwanese tea to make my mouth happy! The leaves of this one are quite thick and shorter than others, but still jet black in color. I saw several long stems mixed in with the leaves. Dry scent is very grainy with sweet cocoa and stonefruit scents. I steeped about 1.5 teaspoons of leaf for 3 minutes at 200 degrees.Hm, unusual aroma for a Taiwanese tea (at least in my experience). It’s quite bready with sweet honey and just a touch of dried fruit. Wow, this definitely tastes different than all of the other Taiwanese blacks I’ve tried! It’s very bready and smooth, and <em>so</em> creamy. It literally tastes (and feels) like there has been cream added to it. It’s definitely a crusty bread with honey butter spread over it. No jam, surprisingly. I usually find a lot of fruitiness in these teas but it’s absent here. There’s a moment in the middle of the sip where this fleetingly tastes like a plain generic black tea, but it’s quickly swept away by an interesting green bean flavor. I think I’m getting just a touch of apricot in the aftertaste, there you are! This is definitely an interesting tea, and since I have enough for another cup, I’ll definitely try it following their directions next time! :)\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Apricot, Baked Bread, Butter, Cream, Green Beans, Honey, Malt\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'This tea intrigued me with its description so I am pleased to finally be able to taste it for myself and post notes.<strong>Dry leaf aroma:</strong> Sweet and slightly malty with a mild trace of tobacco.<strong>Preparation:</strong> I prepped the leaves with an initial 1 second rinse and then proceeded with my session western style (my gaiwan is on the way, so for now I am steeping western style).<strong>First steeping:</strong> <em>2 minutes at 205 degrees.</em> The aroma is basic, a moderate black tea scent with the ever-so-slight hint of something more intricate which I cannot describe accurately. The taste is much more complex and the initial mouth-feel is extremely creamy. I’ve not experienced a black tea quite this creamy before; very nice! Buried in the creaminess is a hint of honey and a very subtle aftertaste of baked bread and banana. At the end of this cup, after it had cooled quite a bit, I detected a citrusy aftertaste in addition to the bread and banana essences. Interestingly, the creamy mouth-feel lingered after each sip. Very unique.<strong>Second steeping:</strong> <em>2 minutes at 205 degrees.</em> I am detecting a subtle baked bread and banana scent along with the straightforward black tea fragrance. This steeping is not as creamy as the first but is still quite rich. The flavors are less complex but the brew still retains the initial profile of cream, honey, baked bread, and a trace of banana. While the cup is hot I am experiencing more of the citrus aftertaste.I’d like to try another session using a gaiwan and multiple short steepings to experiment with influencing the flavor profile.This is a tea that I will add to my permanent stock.

I do occasionally enjoy others as well, like I’m partial to a good Assam and I wouldn’t say no to a low-grown Ceylon or a particularly good Kenya, but deep down the Chinese blacks is where I ‘live’ preference-wise.Taiwanese blacks are sort of the same family (political controversies not even taken into account) and they have lots of the same qualities. Like for example one of the things I like about the Chinese blacks is how they are nearly impossible to ruin. If you have a good leaf, you can steep it to kingdom come and it will still come out perfectly drinkable. Perhaps a little less nice than if you’d done it properly, granted, but it won’t be totally ruined. In comparison, if you did the same thing with an Assam or a Ceylon, it would be a highly unpleasant experience indeed.I don’t have much experience with Taiwan, though. It’s one of those things, you see. You tell yourself you should explore this or that type or this or that area but just never really seem to get around to it. So when I got a newsletter from Yunnan Sourcing, announcing the opening of Taiwan Sourcing, I jumped at the chance immediately and got a small amount of each of the three blacks they offered. The first one was the one I posted about last time I posted. This is one of the other two.This is actually saying a lot, as I have entered a phase where I’m less focused on having an enormous amount of tea choice at all time and wanting to try all the teas and all the shops and all the flavours and find the perfect this and the perfect that. This is what happens when you stop using a site for 8 months. In recent times I’ve rather thrown myself at embroidery and am more likely to be spending money on stitching supplies. (So many designs! So little time!)Anyway, this tea is very minty when you smell it. So minty, you’d think there was mint in it, but there isn’t. There’s a great deal of camphor-y notes to it as well.It’s slightly astringent when drinking it, especially as it cools down a bit, but not nearly so much as to bother those who don’t care for astringency, I don’t think. I mean, we’re not on an Indian teas level of astringency here. But a touch of it, yes. There’s a cinnamon-like aftertaste as mentioned in the description of it, but for me it’s primarily quite malty and dark tasting. It’s very nice.', 'This is an exquisite black tea with a flavor profile unlike any other I’ve tried.

It really is the perfect breakfast tea because you can have savoury (say Vegemite toast) or sweet (cranberry toast) or anything in between – eggs and bacon, cornflakes, everything goes with this tea. I find it’s best when left to infuse for about a minute. I don’t like anything added to it because as is makes for a satisfyingly decadent light drop.I tried this after loving T2’s Crème Brulee – Melbourne Breakfast is far less sweet than this and therefore more suited to first thing in the morning, it’s also not as strong a black tea and is able to be infused for longer without turning bitter.It really does feel like having a sip of Melbourne – it’s decadent, refined and perfect as is.

Medium thickness, rich and smooth with a gentle fading of the flavor lingering softly in the mouth.Delicious dessert tea!This is the only truly chocolaty black tea that I’ve tasted other than Verdant’s and companies that carry Fujian Black Pearls (which are maltier).If this was a stock, I’d buy it!

I took this one to work today, and was drinking it for most of the morning. In all fairness this is a pretty decent dark, chocolaty, malty black tea. (There are more chocolate notes in this one than the oolong I just wrote about). What I didn’t like about this was that it didn’t resteep very well. I normally can get three decent steeps from a straight black. The first steep was great, and then it was all downhill from there. The second steep seemed to have lost all that deep dark goodness, and you were just left with generic black tea. This is quite a bit cheaper than most of my favorite blacks, but if you don’t get the resteep is it really better value? All in all, this is pretty good.', 'to me this is similar to Gong Fu from Zhi Tea…durability seems similar as well,which isn’t so great…pretty tasty though…', 'So it turns out not a single individual in my immediate family cares for these fine chocolatey Chinese black teas. This became more and more apparent as the years went by and all the cupboard’s teas came and went, except for this and Verdant’s Laoshan Black (also, the rooibos). My mother went so far as to call them undrinkable. I’ve merely become indifferent.Oh, well. Moving on. I guess there’s more for everyone else!\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Chocolate, Cocoa, Dirt, Malt, Wood\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Either the leaves were sitting in my cupboard too long or I oversteeped/overleafed this one. Turned a bit bitter :(In my other experiences with this tea, it was a solid chocolatey-note black tea. However, I much prefer (and miss) North Winds for the added complexity of a blend, or Golden Snail for the gardenia note.This is a good tea though, and a good representation of Fujian style black.', 'Chocolatey malty smoothness in a cup. I am only on my first steeping and I am very impressed by this tea. Thanks Beelicious for this in my Secret Pumpkin box!

Same as before – 4g in 4oz gaiwan, 95-100 deg water, hmm what did I do… 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 sec. Now that I’m looking at Brendan’s brewing instructions, he suggests 1.5g per oz, so I guess I underleafed it.These tea leaves are neat – long, skinny, and dark. The dry leaves smell malty and bready, and the scent just intensifies in the wet leaves. Surprisingly to me, he first steeping in particular was quite light, creamy, and sweet – like vanilla or caramel flavoured whipped cream. With subsequent steepings the malt and bread notes came out, but there remained a lovely sweetness, like toasted multigrain bread with honey. Then some fruity, citrusy notes came in so it was like the topping on the toast switched to marmalade. A few steepings in, I went to read what other people had to say about this, and maybe my tastebuds are just broken, because I seem to have lost the ability to appreciate chocolate flavours in tea! When I concentrated, I could appreciate a raw cacao or cocoa powder kind of thing, but it certainly wasn’t what I would consider the dominant flavour. So weird. :)Anyway, this is a yummy tea, I was thinking “nom nom nom” while drinking it. :) I’ll definitely try more leaf next time to see if I can get a richer flavour.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Baked Bread, Fruity, Honey, Malt\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'I guess I haven’t reviewed this one yet! I’ve gongfu brewed it a couple of times, and this one seems to like it if you go heavy and long with it, meaning more leaf, longer brew times. I overdid my third infusion by at least a minute and it came out delicious! Chocolate and stone fruit delicious! Yum! Definitely a good way to start the weekend!', 'A smooth and flavorful black tea that needs no additives. Somewhat weaker than my normal morning cup, but rich and delicious.\\n\\n<p class=\"flavor-names\">Flavors: Cherry, Sugarcane\\n</div>, <div class=\"text\">\\n', 'Thank you <strong>Blodeuyn</strong> for this surprise tea present!This is another win from this company! I open this small package and reveal small delicate ebony shards. These little sticks carry a strong roasted dark cacao scent. I imagine WuYi as a granite rocky cliff with silver and black peaks. This mysterious place is shrouded with mist and overcast causing a gray scale effect. I picture wind blowing massive trees clinging to the rocky cliff faces causing them to sway from side to side like a sailboat caught in a storm. I view the WuYi region like this because their teas are a hurricane of a brew. They consist of dark, mineral, roast, cold, and sharp tones. These teas always have a bold brew that is alike the earths crust. The small black twigs I recieved followed suit, except, they gave me a small surprise. This maroon liquor had a decadent dark chocolate palette. This dessert flavor followed me throughout my steeping. I washed these small leaves once and brewed gong fu. I acquired a deep chocolate tone every steep and the background of black grapes creeped up on me.

For some reason, it’s not as wonderful as I remember it, &amp; seems kind of weak, even though I know I used the same quantity I always use.  It’s probably because my tastebuds &amp; sinuses are allergy-affected.  OR maybe there was a higher ratio of white tea in that TB.  Who knows? Who cares? It still tastes good, &amp; although I drink hot tea year around, I especially enjoy it when the cool weather arrives, &amp; it is pleasantly cool &amp; wonderful here is St. Louis!My visit with <strong>Sil</strong> was awesome, but short. We laughed a lot, &amp; we drank a bunch of tea!

This was my first tea of the morning as i’m nearly done this one so i wanted to make sure i’m working on finishing it off. This weekend i need to get some serious sipdowns in, so i’m trying to help that along this week :) I still enjoy this one but i feel like i’d prefer to just pick up the individual teas. Maybe i’ll try making my own slightly different version heh', 'I’m Back! Hi my Friends!I’ve been very, very sick the past few days with a violent allergic reaction to a handful of dried peas. This was something like being seasick and having the flu and a migraine all at the same time.  Today is the first time I’ve been able to eat anything or drink tea.  Hooray for Tea! Very carefully, I chose a tea that was not flavored with anything that would make me turn green since I’m still a little queezy.  A good malty tea with warm chocolate and caramel tone would go down well and Puer would be good for my stomach also. I’ve had the past version of the Breakfast Blend as a sample, but not the Imperial Breakfast Summer Blend. I had ordered the tasting set of Alchemy Blends which arrived today (great timing).This afternoon, I prepared a 24oz pot of tea. I was so ready, you have no idea how much I had missed tea for 2 days. I chose Western Style brewing so that I could continue with multiple steepings for soothing my stomach throughout the afternoon and to rehydrate myself.Steep time 1min. Color of liquor light golden honey brown.The tea was malty and naturally cocoa cinnamon with good body. The richness was what I wanted…a real tea hug. I can’t explain it better than that. I love this tea flavor. Malty, caramelly, cocoa rich tea makes me do a bad, bad thing.  I have an addiction! When I run into a very good malty tea, I go to my secret stash of ginger cookies and take a few… and slowly break off pieces of cookie and eat it crumb by sweet spicy crumb while drinking the malty cocoa, creamy tea.  I can’t explain the sensual goodness…the delight in this combination…of unsweetened tea…that blends in the mouth with the sweet of the ginger cookie somehow enhancing the flavor of the tea. Oh My Goodness! Absolutely sensational!So, yes…ok…I went for it and had the cookies and tea and I came alive again! (Here I should insert organ music like in the Phantom of the Opera…She’s Alive!)…The tea was…Delicious!I’ve conversed with a few people lately about what Puer would be good for evey day use and this is one tea that I recommend because the Puer is mixed with other tea’s as a blend. This is such a delicious tea, a perfect way to begin the day and a wonderful tea to have as an afternoon stress reducer.I’m back! (Not in the horror movie sense of the phrase) ; )', 'First tea of the day here, we are under a snowfall warning, so my plans for the day are to sip tea and make cookies later! And watch my kitty, he got fixed yesterday poor little guy so he has to wear a cone now and he really doesn’t like it! :( so lots of pets for him today! Anyways, back to this tea, it’s so tasty western style! I should try the last little bit in my gaiwan, but it’s just so cozy and warming and soft in the mug. It went nicely with my waffles with apricot jam for breakfast. An excellent tea! See previous notes :)', 'This is SO SO SO SO Good!!!  Now THIS is what I’m talking about!  Chocolate  Malt Caramel Vanilla Cinnamon but only ever so slightly  Creamy  DREAMY!!!!  Yes in fact I do get all these flavor elements and what a lovely wonderful much needed grounding tea right now!  Everyone’s schedule in this house is chaotic with exception of mine so I am the one doing backflips to accommodate everyone else after 10 years of being the only one working in the house and everyone accommodating ME lol Its nice to have more income indeed and wonderful WONDERFUL that my daughter is working not one but TWO jobs September 31 of last year will be a YEAR since her neurosurgery!!  Amazing I am proud and grateful!  Still OMG make the noise STOP!!!!  LOL  everyone is bouncing off the walls and I am needing much more grounding, center, and focus to do MY work which is being fit into when I can get it done. SO with that said – OH YES bring it on – THIS is the perfect tea for this. I am glad I got a sampler and now I am off to get a BUNCH of this!', 'After David’s MARVY Surprise Yesterday of a Karate Chop to the Taste Buds – I decided to try this one out to begin my day! I’m on my 2nd cup already and I’m really liking this!A blend of Black, Oolong, Pu-erh, and White teas…I’m game!I can totally taste individually and as a harmonious combo of the Black, Oolong, and Pu-erh. The white is slightly noted in the background, but not overly so. This is amazingly creative and the loose leaf ratios of each are done awesomely – in my opinion.I haven’t been sleeping well the last several weeks. It’s my dogs. Mostly the one…Riley…he wakes me up at 3 – not sure what changed – he never has done this prior to a few weeks ago. I’m a Night Owl…I usually get settled in around midnight or 1. With Riley waking me up at 3…that isn’t fun…on top of that DH gets up for work at 3:30-ish and leaves shortly after 4. My alarm is set for 5:55 but I haven’t been making it that long lately. Riley either wants water, has to pee, wants to eat (he’s a piggie), or just wants to lay on the sofa. And that’s where I end up…on the sofa. Tremendous.This morning in addition to lack of sleep Suzie (the other dog) bolted out of a dead sleep on the sofa and lunged at Riley – which I refer to as the “Bitch Attack”…I jump off the sofa and had to pry them off each other. 99.9% of the time these two dogs LOVE each other…but when the “Queen of the Castle” is in a dead sleep and the other one is too close to her she sometimes freaks.So while this was happening…I could feel various tendons and muscles ripping in my neck, shoulder, and back. OYE.So…yes…long story and way too much info…I totally needed a special tea to help me start my day!This is IT!!!This is certainly on the verge of a Karate Chop AKA Ninja Tea but not as in-your-face as the other GEM from yesterday. Perhaps I will refer to this one as The Round-House Kick :)Malty-Chocolaty notes first and foremost are overly welcome and appreciated.There are some cinnamon powdery hints throughout (even more-so in the 2nd infusion)It has some odd but lovely creamy flavors that move like a football-stadium-crowd-wave throughout the sip.In the first infusion – not really in the 2nd – I could taste reminiscent flavors of wet noodles as well. Also in the 1st infusion there was a completely different texture than in the 2nd infusion. It was somewhat grainy…much like a Gluten-Free Pasta Alternative or something. I found this very different, interesting, and likable.This is a real work of art! Another wonderful offering from David and Verdant!!!!', 'Oh wow… from the aroma of the dry leaves I was expecting this to taste a lot like the Laoshan black, but it’s much richer and smokier – maybe that’s the pu’er, or the Big Red Robe? I don’t know, but I like it. I can taste the oolong for sure, but not a lot of caramel or vanilla on the first steep; on the second the caramel started coming out, and the oolong is still prominent. I don’t know my pu’ers well enough to pull out either of those flavors. There is a solid cocoa flavor, thanks to the Laoshan.This has a stronger flavor than the two straight black teas I’ve had from Verdant (Laoshan and Golden Fleece), which I like. As a breakfast tea, it certainly makes me more willing to face the day, if it means getting more tea like this!On steep 10 or so, I found this getting unexpectedly creamy. I hadn’t noticed any cinnamon in the flavor, but my mouth is convinced I’m drinking a light chai. Nifty!<em>gongfu style, 3g leaf to 3.5oz water, steeps starting ~5 seconds</em>', 'Sipdown! Thanks <strong>Sil</strong>!I re-read my tasting note of this from last time, and I pretty much would write an identical note this time. The flavour is very reminiscent of a lighter Laoshan Black, but perhaps with a bit more sweetness, and there is more depth in the flavour profile, in that there are many different things going on here. I’m choosing not to think about them too much though, and just enjoy this. As I mentioned before, this would be a great morning blend for me, as I’m not one for a tea with any sort of astringency/punch in the morning, as my stomach does <strong>not</strong> like that. Not to say that this isn’t packed with flavour, but it’s not an assault on my mouth, as I presume (perhaps incorrectly) many breakfast blends to be. All robust and strong.Anyhow! A yummy cup, sad to see it go but I probably could recreate something pretty close with the other teas I have from Verdant, hahaha.', '2 tsp for 300mL @100C, steeped four minutes Western style, drunk bare.Oh, oh, oh.Liquor is quite dark, letting me know there’s pu-erh in the blend. I can smell the pu-erh, too, and it’s a type of tea I generally don’t care for, but it’s giving heft and depth to this blend. Bready and toasty — roasted grains, and a winey finish that reminds me of some good Keemuns. Some faint Yunnan pepper, stronger in the aftertaste, and some honey notes. Florals in the finish, too. Deep notes of cocoa and sweet potato and minerals. Wow. I’ve never tasted a blend like this.', 'As is the norm for me, because I can’t remember from nose to mouth, I placed a Verdant Tea order and promptly forgot about what three quarters of it was. Then I saw <strong>TerriHarpLady</strong> post about this one and hoped that it would be in there. And it was! How excellent!On the paper it sounds like an extremely interesting blend and not a single ingredient like your average breakfast blends. No Assam, no Ceylon, no Keemun. Is it even possible to create something breakfast-y without those three? Yes. Yes it is, apparently. Instead a mixture of the Laoshan Black (which I lurve) and some Jin Jun Mei, which <strong>Spoonvonstup</strong> introduced me to (although I preferred the Fujian ones, but really… who’s surprised by that?), and then some Da Hong Pao and some Silver Needle and some pu’erh to fill out and accentuate and what have you. I mean seriously! I’m not surprised that it turned out that I did order some of this. I’m highly surprised that I couldn’t remember doing so, because really! O.O I sounds like the sort of thing I’d remember…The leaf smelled wonderfully grainy, and there were some Yunnan-y notes in there, but none of the ones that I don’t like. When I was pouring it after steeping (still from the stupid pot and over the sink, WHEN OH WHEN will my new Roy Kirkham china arrive???) I got a faceful of something thick, sweet and grainy. It’s really hard to describe this aroma as anything other than thick. It smells like something that really ought to be tangible at first. After the cup has settled down a bit, it becomes less so and actual notes start to seep out.My first thought is dulce de leche. And LOTS of it! Underneath that something chocolate-y and something cinnamon-y an just a smidge of smoke, which weirdly manages to somehow not be a top note. <em>blink</em> I don’t get that bit. Smoke has <em>always</em> been a top note for me. Always! Curious.This peculiarity is fixed in the flavour, though, where the smidge of smoke is restored to its rightful place at the top. And all is again right with the world. That note is immediately followed by the chocolate, cinnamon, dulce de leche combination, which lasts for the entire sip and then goes straight to the aftertaste, which, to my surprise, is indeed with a bit of vanilla to it. I wasn’t actually expecting that. Whenever I see vanilla (and to some degree also caramel) described as a naturally occurring flavour in something, I can never seem to find any, so I’ve stopped expecting it. Maybe it has to do with my obsession with finding the perfect vanilla flavoured black?It’s not until after I’ve swallowed that I realise something is missing. Where exactly was the body in this? Where was that grain and malt and stuff that I picked up from the dry leaf? Where did that go? Laoshan Black and Jin Jun Mei are both teas with pretty assertive and strong flavours, so… where did they go? It’s like all their top notes just banded together, ganged up on the rest of the notes and locked them in a cellar somewhere. I can’t find even a hint of grain in this. How peculiar!And yet… And yet, if you really <em>could</em> take the body notes out of the equation all together, I don’t think you would actually end up with this result. They <em>are</em> there, I just can’t taste them because they are the stuff that holds all the rest together in a united front. Without them, it would probably just be something that tasted layered and somewhat thin. They <em>are</em> there. They <em>are</em> important notes. They’re just working behind the scenes on this one.I apologise for that last be becoming a little odd. Blame it on my having acquired some sicks somewhere, it seems. I feel all ‘W and F’, as the father in law says (Weak &amp; Feeble).‘Peculiar’ seems to be the keyword here. What an all round peculiar tea. Peculiar, but living up to my initial expectations completely and utterly. <strong>Auggy,</strong> there will definitely be a share of this in your care package.

I have had black teas processed closely to how this one was and they have not been as good. The other dark Jin Xuans I’ve had are usually to “ripe”, thick, or sweet nevermind I enjoy naturally sweet teas with some texture. I love that this has very little astringency and bitterness. In terms of notes, I got the honey mostly followed by the honeysuckle, caramel, and orange. It was actually very similar to What-Cha’s Vietnam Red Buffalo, but the mouth feel was a touch heavier and more malty making it more obvious that this was a black tea.Out of all the black samples from Golden Tea Leaf, I would drink this one the most often. Like Amanda said, this tea was also very forgiving making it a better option for leaving the leaves in the brewing apparatus, namely a tumbler. You might be able to Gong Fu it, but Western is easier. A part of me actually liked this more than the Gold Red Tea (though I liked the complexity more of the Gold Red), and I definitely preferred it to the Sun Moon Lake since I like lighter black teas. I do drink Yunnan Gold Buds often, after all.Not a bad black tea to try if you are trying to expand your hong cha horizon, and definitely good for those who like forgiving and softer black teas.', 'If you are like me and a real lover of schedules, you are probably noticing that it is Thursday and there is a blog and that there was no blog on Wednesday like there was supposed to be. Blame Ben. This week and next he has Wednesday off, and since we only have the one computer (and he is the one with the job) I was nice and let him have full access to it all day. The single computer ordeal is soon to be over as a friend is hooking me up with a killer nice tower and surround sound speaker system, so no more polite computer sharing.Today I am looking at quite the fascinating tea, Golden Tea Leaf’s Honey Red Jade Tea, a bug bitten red tea that has been tightly rolled similar in appearance to an Oolong. It is no secret that I am a bit obsessed with Taiwanese teas that have been nibbled on by leafhoppers, be it a Hongcha or an Oolong, their natural sweetness and complexity have skyrocketed them into being a comfort tea and not just one I seek out because of its deliciousness. The aroma of the leaves is…well…it is hard to put into words that are sensical and not just ‘holy yum sweet om nom nom’ so it took me a few sniffs to calm down enough to articulate. There are notes of caramel coated hazelnuts and cashews, stewed pears and plums, honey-drizzled pumpkins, and a rich heady distant note of plumeria blossoms. It is very sweet and rich, one of those teas I feel like I am sinking into while sniffing it.I decided to brew this tea n my yixing devoted to Taiwanese Hongcha, which sees a lot of bug-bitten teas! The aroma of the brewed leaves is very rich and sweet, with notes of caramel, figs, cooked plums and pears, plumeria blossoms, and a finish of cooked pumpkin and brown sugar. The liquid is sweet and nutty, notes of honey and cashews blend with cooked pears and plums with a finish of caramelized figs and distant tropical flowers. It smells intense and mouthwatering, the perfect amount of sweetness and richness to push this tea over into a dessert tea.If you like a tea that manages to be very sweet, very fruity, and floral while maintaining a rich quality, then boy do I ever have the tea for you! So before I get into the outstanding taste, I need to mention the pleasant mouthfeel. It is smooth and thick, not the point of an Oolong thickness, but it coats the mouth and is velvety in its texture. Ok, now for that decadent taste, it starts with a dessert-like combination of stewed pears, plums, and pumpkin with a sprinkling of cashews and brown sugar. Next, the flowers start, orchid and plumeria with a hint of honeysuckle and lilies, it is heady without being perfumed like an Oolong. The aftertaste is cashews and lilies and they linger for quite a while.The second steep is impressively intense, it takes the same notes (with a gentle extra woodiness in the middle) but ramps it up! The sweetness is sweeter, the flowers more like nectar rather than just blossoms, and the fruit notes take on an almost pie like quality. No longer just a dessert of stewed fruit, the pie is on! The sweet nutty aftertaste continues, but instead of lily the aftertaste is, of all things, persimmon, which was a fantastic surprise.So the first two steeps I drank while they were hot, the third steep I decided to play around with by letting it cool to room temperature, since according to the website this tea is even better when cooled. I find that hard to believe since it is already pretty fantastic! Drinking this tea cool is truly where it really shines, notes of orange blossom and malt show up, along with caramelized pears and heady plumeria. It is beautifully rich and smooth, I could become addicted to this tea! One thing I found really useful is it seemed impossible to over-steep this tea, I could toss leaves into a bowl and bowl-steep this tea for hours and it never gets bitter, meaning it is perfect for tossing in my travel tumbler.

I’m not saying that is good, bad, or indifferent – it’s just something I was surprised by. It had a woodsy-type flavor that seemed to come and go. I do like this tea. It’s satisfying. Honey Red Jade Tea from Golden Leaf Tea is pleasant and not overly done in any way. Perhaps this would be a nice loose leaf to share with friends…especially if you are unsure of their tea tastes.

Personally, and seriously, I am not saying it because my company is selling this tea. But I like my oolong, puerh, and a good cup of strong black tea.
