    "### Tasting Considerations\n",
    "* Aroma: The odor of the tea liquor, also called the nose or fragrance. A complex aroma is often described as a bouquet. \n",
    "* Astringency: A lively and mouth-drying effect on the tongue. Not bitter, but a clean and refreshing quality. The sensation of astringency is caused by a reaction between polyphenols (tannins) and the protein in saliva. \n",
    "* Body: The tactile aspect of tea’s weight and substance in the mouth, variously subcategorized as light, medium, or full; also known as fullness. \n",
    "* Bright: A lively, clean style that refreshes the palate. \n",
    "* Character: A tea’s signature attributes depending upon origin, whether of its country, region or type. \n",
    "* Clean: Indicates purity of flavor and an absence of any off-tastes. \n",
    "* Finish: The lasting taste on your tongue after swallowing the tea. \n",
    "* Flowery: A floral nose or flavor associated with high grade teas. \n",
    "* Full: References a positive sensation of body and good heft; indicates a well-made tea, possessing color, strength, substance and roundness. \n",
    "* Malty: A sweet malt flavor that is characteristic of Assam black teas. \n",
    "* Muscatel: A flavor reminiscent of grapes, most often used to describe an exceptional characteristic found in the liquors of the finest Darjeelings. \n",
    "* Smooth: Round-bodied, fine-drinking teas. \n",
    "* Soft: Smooth, lush, and subsequently often (but not necessarily) timid in flavor; not a negative term. \n",
    "* Thick: Describes liquor having substance, but not necessarily strength. \n",
    "* Vegetal: A characteristic of green teas that might include grassy, herby or marine flavors."
