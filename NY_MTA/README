Project 1

We are tasked with analyzing the New York MTA turnstile data to create recommendations for a nonprofit.  The goal was to find the best stations to send volunteers for them to solicit emails for their gala in the summer.  This is a theoretical exercise.

Executive summary from project presentation:
Being a budding tech non-profit, WTWY has few advocates and touch points to communicate the gala.  Itâ€™s necessary to target high traffic stations and stations near philanthropic companies to get the information out effectively. We have selected 9 stations for volunteers to solicit e-mail sign ups that maximize the number of e-mail sign-ups.
