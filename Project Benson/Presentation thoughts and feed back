Learning from my first presentation at Metis

The first presenation I did at Metis was over analyzing NEw York City Metro Transit Subway data to recommend how a non-profit should disperse their volunteers.  The volunteers will be sent to the recommended stations and solicit email sign ups from riders for free tickets to their Summer Gala.  The data analysis took most of the time, and the last day (we had a full week to prepare) my group and I focused on the presentation.  The presentation was a bit wordy and the graphs had a bit too much going on (we used top 20 stations, probably should have knocked it down to 10).  I also needed to speak louder and point to the presentation less.  Lastly, I could have been more enthusiastic and engaging to the audience.  The map we used could have stood out a bit more, or been colored for each locations importance.  All of the nicer graphs from my favorite presentaiton came from Matplotlib, and it was saved from ipython as a png, rather than taking a snapshot of it then pasting it in the presentation.

The data we included was mta data, data on the where tech company's were located in NY, and whre the most philanthropic companies are located.
