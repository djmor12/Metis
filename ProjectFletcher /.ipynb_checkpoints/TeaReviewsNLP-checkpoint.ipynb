       " 'Tea Reviews': ['Happy Thanksgiving (Gratitude Day) to everyone in the World!!  I know Thanksgiving is an American holiday, but I hope everybody everywhere has things to be grateful for everyday. I think it’s important to take a few minutes at least once a day to be grateful for all that I have, all that I am, and all that I’m yet to be, and to wish for wonderful things in the lives of others as well.I started my day by making 3 pie crusts, all gluten free. One is for a pie that I’ve made for years called Chocolate Midnight (Originally Chocolate Almond Midnight because of a praline almond decorative topping I omitted, from the vegan Millenium Cookbook) It’s the most decadent chocolate cheesecake textured pie you’ll ever eat, and you’ll never know it’s made with silken tofu. I know you don’t believe me, if you’ve ever had a silken tofu ‘fail’ dessert, and believe me, when I was a vegan (for years and years), I tried my share.Baby, this is the real deal, and many people have fallen in love with this pie, not knowing the tofu truth, and once they found out, they didn’t care, it’s that good. It’s requested by several people every year &amp; is a required part of our family feast. This year I took the gluten out of the crust.I’m in the break, between crust making and pie filling making. I had a hearty breakfast and my last cup of Stacy’s Taiwanese Assam. I’ve reviewed it several times, and it is bold and tasty, but now it’s gone. I foresee a Butiki order coming soon.',\n",
       "  'Sometimes you just need an old favourite. This morning was one of those days. I had let the wonder of this tea become a mere shadow of its true deliciousness. I’m glad I dug this out earlier…just needed a reminder of how much I love it!',\n",
       "  'Wowwwww, this is delicious! Definitely glad I ordered some (shoulda got my free ounce of this instead of Strawberry Oolong!) It reminds me quite a bit of Laoshan Black, in that it’s very malty and chocolatey, but there’s quite a fruitiness to it as well. I had this in the Timolino, so I need to write a more detailed tasting note later, but this is definitely a winner for me. And the leaves are crazy huge, thin, wiry, unbroken. Fabulous!I’m drinking the second infusion right now. It’s heading towards astringent in spite of only a 3-minutes infusion, but it’s still good. I’m sure it would be better re-steeped immediately instead of sitting all day.Rating tentatively placed, but may increase upon proper evaluation.',\n",
       "  'This week has been pretty busy for us. We just got back from vacation mid week which was really a work vacation and will start prepping for another office closure as we will probably be taking off for another 2 weeks in about two weeks but this time for a real vacation. Also, we received in a ton of tea, including many new teas. We are also changing up a few teas. Here is a sneak peek of just a few of the many changes:Adding: Hattialli Golden Paw (very similar to our Hattialli Golden Lion)Changing: Irish Cream Cheesecake. Based on the reviews, we are thinking the base is just wrong for the flavoring. We used our everyday Sourenee, which is very good but also very fickle. It can be pretty challenging to get that tea to its sweet spot and it can turn astringent if the water cools too much.Changing: Sourenee. We are exchanging the current everyday Sourenee for a very high quality limited edition Sourenee.Adding: Hello Sweetie. It’s coming soon but first we will be doing a promotion with it.Changing: Da Yu Ling. We moved too slowly on the Da Yu Ling for the winter harvest but the Fu Shou Shan is a fantastic replacement!Adding: A baked Ali Shan.Mi Xian: Just a little warning. We are low on Mi Xian right now and will not be able to get more when we run out as it is scarce at the moment.These are just a few additions and changes. There are many more to come and many more flavors in the works, including the Custom Blend Contest tea which is getting close to finishing the recipe. We will also be removing a few flavors and teas that just aren’t up to the standards of the rest of the teas. I would love to hear any suggestions from anyone who believes there is a tea that should be removed from our collection.On to the tea! This harvest has a slightly deeper dark chocolate note. There really isn’t much difference from this harvest and the last harvest but the chocolate is stronger and the malt is slightly stronger. There are less stems, which is fantastic! The upgrade version on the other hand has some cherry notes that were not detectable in the previous version.',\n",
       "  'Yowza! I was starting to think that I wouldn’t need to order any more of this tea because the Caramel Vanilla is so amazing, but this cup convinced me that I need both.',\n",
       "  'Reading my book and sipping on this for the last two hours.I made it the way I really like it when I have all the time in the world for it. I fill the gaiwan with leaves, really, I fill it almost to the top. This tea is light in weight, so for me, that’s the best way to extract all the goodness I know is in there. It might seems like a lot of tea to waist, but it’s no waist when you can brew it for several hours. And the steeps remain rich and flavourful. A good night companion…This is another one from Butiki I’m hoping will never disappear!(See previous notes)',\n",
       "  'Still kind of disappointed I missed the Butiki sale due to vacation, but I still have enough of this to last me a little while, so I can’t complain too much. :-) I’m on my 4th steep of the morning. It went so well with the buttermilk scone I had for breakfast. See other notes for details.',\n",
       "  'Prepped according to the below parameters – 2 tsp. leaf to 8 oz. water as per package directions.The last few nights at work were rough but I don’t go back in until Thursday night at least. Sometimes I wonder what I was thinking, becoming a nurse. I love it but I’m such an introvert that I get positively drained after a few shifts and need the time to recover.  Speaking of introverts, I discovered I’m an INFJ recently. Anybody else know their MBTI type?I say all this to explain why I’m drinking a strong cup of this malty, chocolate wonder now, instead of going straight to bed. It is so smooth, rich and comforting. Something about the smell of a freshly brewed, good black tea just relaxes me, and this is no exception. Strange how a tea can manage to be both calming and energizing simultaneously – but this one does that.Just what I needed for right now…',\n",
       "  'I fixed my Steepster at work problem and now I can load it again at work! Maybe not great for my productivity but great for my overall happiness.Sipdown, 116. I have a lot of Taiwanese black teas in my sipdown list, but this is my favorite for sure. It’s not too fruity-floral but it does have nicely fruity notes. Caramel, sometimes a hint of cocoa, and hard to really oversteep. Definitely will restock this one, perhaps on Black Friday!',\n",
       "  'The leaves of this tea are stunning! Twisty and wirey with almost a blue tone hue to them.  The steeped cup is a lovely deep golden amber tone and smells of sweet potato and chocolate! OMG yes!  This cup is DELICIOUS! For my facebook friends who may be reading this – as I am going to be posting the review there as well…if you are not used to really high quality amazing tea like this just understand – this is not your mother’s or grandmother’s Lipton tea! Haha, my grandmother, bless her heart would drink that instant powdered tea daily, you know the stuff that came in the glass jar with the green lid. Today it is probably in plastic but regardless – this is a true delight and anyone who is even considering trying a different black tea should give this one a go!  There is a very sweet aspect to the tea, it has notes of sweet potato pie, even a bake-y element to it but it is not that sweet – not like as if someone spooned sugar into the cup – just a very natural sweetness. There are strong notes of chocolate and also notes of honey.  A very rich cup yet the mouthfeel is bright and cheery. It is not too heavy or syrupy. This may be one of my new favorites! I wish I had tried this one sooner!  As if I do not have enough teas to drink I have added this one to my shopping list!  There is a slight very light note of cinnamon or some kick of spiciness here but nothing that my weenie husband could not handle …(love you babe)… and oddly enough I am even getting a bit of a saffron note!  As the tea cools a bit it does become slightly thicker with a heavier mouthfeel and notes of maple syrup begin to peek through.  I know it sounds like I am talking about a dessert not a tea yet this is not a dessert tea but rather a wonderful black tea that anyone would love!']}"

    "* Aroma: The odor of the tea liquor, also called the nose or fragrance. A complex aroma is often described as a bouquet. \n",
    "* Astringency: A lively and mouth-drying effect on the tongue. Not bitter, but a clean and refreshing quality. The sensation of astringency is caused by a reaction between polyphenols (tannins) and the protein in saliva. \n",
    "* Body: The tactile aspect of tea’s weight and substance in the mouth, variously subcategorized as light, medium, or full; also known as fullness. \n",
    "* Bright: A lively, clean style that refreshes the palate. \n",
    "* Character: A tea’s signature attributes depending upon origin, whether of its country, region or type. \n",
    "* Clean: Indicates purity of flavor and an absence of any off-tastes. \n",
    "* Finish: The lasting taste on your tongue after swallowing the tea. \n",
    "* Flowery: A floral nose or flavor associated with high grade teas. \n",
    "* Full: References a positive sensation of body and good heft; indicates a well-made tea, possessing color, strength, substance and roundness. \n",
    "* Malty: A sweet malt flavor that is characteristic of Assam black teas. \n",
    "* Muscatel: A flavor reminiscent of grapes, most often used to describe an exceptional characteristic found in the liquors of the finest Darjeelings. \n",
    "* Smooth: Round-bodied, fine-drinking teas. \n",
    "* Soft: Smooth, lush, and subsequently often (but not necessarily) timid in flavor; not a negative term. \n",
    "* Thick: Describes liquor having substance, but not necessarily strength. \n",
    "* Vegetal: A characteristic of green teas that might include grassy, herby or marine flavors."
